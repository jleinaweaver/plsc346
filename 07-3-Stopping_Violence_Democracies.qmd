Prep for Class

1. Review submissions on Canvas

2. Prep Google spreadsheet for unpacking cases (make sure it is visible on the Modules page)

<br>

Our overarching goal for this section of the class is to answer this question.

- How and why do governments use violence against the people inside their borders?

<br>

My hope is that all of the work we have done thus far has given you the tools you need to explain government violence as a strategy.

<br>

Our next aim is to use all of this material (cases, data, theories) to develop real-world strategies for preventing political violence by governments.

**Case Studies of Groups Reducing Political Violence in Democracies**

::: notes

**Everybody ready to go with this?**

<br>

I'd like to unpack your cases in the same way we have done for other case studies in previous weeks.

- Everybody open the Google Sheet linked through our Canvas Modules for today

- Start by copying your citation and brief case description from the discussion board onto the spreadsheet.

<br>

**SLIDE**: As before, I'll give you short instruments and you'll measure your cases

**The Inciting Incident**

1. Who committed the violent act?

2. Who did they target?

3. What did they do?

4. Why is this "political violence"?

:::

::: notes

*Add Columns*

Let's start by focusing on the inciting incident

- e.g. what political violence was being done that needed intervention?

<br>

Fill in these details for your case on the spreadsheet.

- Keep your answers concise BUT be specific!

- I know that feels like contradictory instructions but that's the challenge of measuring a case

**The Intervention**

1. Who intervened?

2. Who did they target?

3. What did they do?

4. How successful were they?

:::

::: notes

*Add Columns*

Let's now shift to the intervention

- e.g. The response to the violent act

<br>

Fill in these details for your case on the spreadsheet.

- Keep your answers concise BUT be specific!

<br>

*Split class into GROUPS*

- Go sit with your group!

[**What are the key elements of a successful intervention to change the use of political violence by democractic governments?**]{style="color:white;"}

::: notes

GROUPS: Use the data to brainstorm / derive lessons we can take away for how best to design interventions meant to reduce political violence by democracies

- Get ready to pitch us your hypotheses!

<br>

PRESENT and DISCUSS each

<br>

**SLIDE**: Detour back to the second paper

## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

Political Violence Country Briefings

Select **two countries** (no overlapping cases in class) and analyze their recent experience of political violence using **ALL FIVE** of the data sources we explored in class

For **EACH** country you must produce a **TWO PAGE** country briefing report that summarizes and visualizes the findings of your analyses

- 2 countries x 2 pages = 4 pages total

- You should aim to analyze at least the last five years of available data for each country.

::: notes

Don't forget this assignment is ongoing and is due at the end of week 9

- **Questions on the prompt?**

<br>

And hopefully everyone is making progress on this.

- Remember, we'll review your big picture conclusions and visualizations in class on the Monday of that week

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next week
