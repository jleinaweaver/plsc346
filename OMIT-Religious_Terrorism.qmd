### Prep for Class
1. Prep email link to Google Doc to collect cases for Monday
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxpQcFCyLm9UySFbvhUDyl9pe0c-C3P4VeOAjqGGN2U/edit?usp=sharing

<br>

Today's Agenda: Explore Sedgwick's (2004) arguments concerning religious terrorism.

- Is it fundamentally different?

- Do we need special strategies to counter it?

.size45[**Q1. How does the framing of this project help us answer our question?**]

::: notes

Let's talk about the framing of the paper.

### What is the question and how is it worded?
- (Is religious terrorism a distinctly different form of terrorism?)

<br>

### What literature is the paper connected to?

- *Force discussion of Rapoport's "waves" of terrorism: What describes the waves? Is this a useful typology?* p796



<br>

### What are the key concepts and how are they defined?

<br>

Central to this paper and its framing is the role of Al Qaeda as its central case study.

The question is, how much is AQ a "religious" terror group and how much is it simply a terror group.

Or, similarly to our discussion on Monday, is religious terror distinct enough from other forms of terror as to need to be studied separately?

.size60[
Make two lists:

+ AQ is a "religious" terror group
+ AQ is like any other terror group
]

::: notes

Everybody take a few minutes on their own to brainstorm two lists.

*ON BOARD: "AQ = Islamic Terrorism" vs "AQ = Terrorism"*

Think of these like two arguments:

#### 1. IN WHAT WAYS IS AQ A "RELIGIOUS" TYPE OF TERROR GROUP?

#### 2. IN WHAT WAYS IS AQ LIKE ANY OTHER TERROR GROUP?

<br>

*ON BOARD: Gather items under each header* 

("AQ = Islamic Terrorism")

- Religion is central to the way Al Qaeda defines its ultimate aims, its constituency and the way it motivates its operatives.
- Ultimate aims are religious
- Recruits from a specific religious constituency
- Appeals to a vast "potential constituency"
- Uses many religious concepts
- Appropriates ascetic traditions, martyrdom
- 9/11 "Last Night" document to motivate and keep operatives in line
- Constituency defined by Islam
- Adopts the language and stories of Islam to teach its goals
- "When it comes to mobilizing support from within its constituency, mainstream Islamic concepts of duty, ascetic devotion, and piety may be used to political ends" (806).

("AQ = Terrorism")

- HOWEVER, its immediate aims are essentially political in nature.
- Check conclusion re: religious roots of secular terrorism (808-809)
- ?

<br>

### Are we convinced that this is sufficient to define aq as a special type of terrorism?

#### - Why or why not?

.size45[.center[.textred[**Ultimate Aims vs Immediate Objectives**]]]

::: notes

Key to this analysis is that Sedgwick differentiates between ultimate aims and immediate objectives.

### What is the strongest argument to do this?

<br>

### What is the strongest argument against it?

<br>

### Is this an arbitrary divide in order to support the argument or a separation of two distinctly different things?

*Make sure both sides of debate represented*

<br>

### What sources of evidence does sedgwick draw on to support his argument?

#### - Is it convincing? Why or why not?

- Non-quantitative piece can make it much harder to assess the evidence provided.
- Very brief historical case studies (797-799) The Thugs, the Assassins and the Zealots
- "propaganda of the deed": Anarchist Errico Malatesta (1853â€“1932)

<br>

Let's shift to the 9/11 strategy argument.

### What is Sedgwick's argument as to the strategic purpose of the 9/11 attacks?

(SLIDE)

9/11 as Strategy

+ Propaganda to build support
+ Provoke self-defeating actions
]

::: notes

(9/11 was primarily a propaganda strategy for building support)

and 

(secondarily an attempt to provoke US into actions that would alienate us further.)

<br>

### Is that a convincing argument? Why or why not?

#### - Are the proposed alternatives an exhaustive list?

#### - Are the alternatives presented in their strongest versions? any straw men?

.size45[**Q3. How does the analysis in this project help us answer our big question?**]

::: notes

### Overall, what are the strengths and weaknesses of this research article?

(Strengths)

1. "propaganda of the deed" is closest thing to a coherent theory of terrorist action, but needs to be fleshed out.

<br>

(Weaknesses)

1. Lacks a coherent theory / clearly testable hypotheses.
    - How do I use this to look at the world and see if you are right?
    - Is "propaganda of the deed" supposed to be a uniquely religious terror strategy or just something AQ does?

2. Historical analogies are interesting but I'm not sure what they prove?
    - Ultimately, seems to be that sedgwick argues religious terror is a distinct thing but the three best known examples of it aren't really it...

### If so, do we need special strategies to counter it?

::: notes

### Thinking about the papers this week, are we convinced that a typology approach to terrorism is a useful strategy for policymakers seeking to reduce the risks?

- Nationalist (ETA, IRA), 
- Religious (ISIS, AQ), 
- Ideological leftists (Communists, anarchists), 
- Ideological right (Nazis, skinheads, Klan)

<br>

### If our aim is to predict the behavior of terrorist groups, in what ways does a typology help? In what ways does it hurt?

<br>

### If our aim is to design strategies to combat terrorist groups, in what ways does a typology help? In what ways does it hurt?

<br>

### Does a typology add something useful to our definition of terrorism or not?

## For Monday

.size55[
Bring to class a piece of evidence showing terrorism (e.g. a terrorist group, a terrorist threat or a specific terror attack) changing the behavior of a target audience (e.g. society, community, government) in some specific way.
]

::: notes

*Send email*

Next week we examine the ongoing debate about whether or not terrorism "works" as a strategy.

We'll kick off by examining case studies you collect for us!

### Any questions on the prompt for Monday?
