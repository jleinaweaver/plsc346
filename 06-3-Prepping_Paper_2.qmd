Prep for Class

1. Post combined dataset on Canvas

2. Bring combined dataset to class for classroom PC

## Paper 1 {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

Which **SINGLE** data source would you recommend to someone interested in better understanding the use of political violence by governments around the world?

- Your thesis should be a clear recommendation for **ONE** of the sources and should be supported by **AT LEAST THREE distinct reasons** for your recommendation

- **A high quality recommendation** will also make clear **why** you are not recommending the other sources

::: notes

Last two weeks we have been exploring and analyzing the data and research projects that exist to track political violence by governments

<br>

We've been thorough and I'll bet you now have a strong sense of this data's strengths and weaknesses.

<br>

**SLIDE**: In paper 2 you will have the opportunity to use your newfound expertise to analyze the world!

Political Violence Country Briefings

Select **two countries** (no overlapping cases in class) and analyze their recent experience of political violence using **ALL FIVE** of the data sources we explored in class

For **EACH** country you must produce a **TWO PAGE** country briefing report that summarizes and visualizes the findings of your analyses

::: {.fragment}

- 2 countries x 2 pages = 4 pages total

- You should aim to analyze at least the last five years of available data for each country.

:::

::: notes

Remember:

- All the sources means State Dept, AI, PTS, CIRIGHTS and V-Dem!

- You must provide context for your claims. Use those primary source documents!

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

To make this easier for you I have posted a dataset on Canvas that merges all the sources together

- Everybody grab the data and open it up

- Let's start by selecting countries

<br>

NEXT, I need EVERYONE to audit the dataset for their two countries

- Did my merge code pull together the right results for your countries?

**Basic Data Analysis**

1. Tables 

2. Bar Plots

3. Line Plots

4. Scatter Plots

:::
::: notes

We covered all of these tools in extensive detail in Data Analysis, but let's do a quick refresher

:::




## 1. Tables {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/06-3-Piazza_Choi2018-Table1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The most common use of tables in the academic literature is to give the reader a sense of the shape of the data (since they wont have access to it)

<br>

Typical summary or descriptive statistics table includes:

- Number of observations (N)

- Mean and Standard Deviation

- Range: Minimum and Maximum

<br>

This selection of statistics instantly tells you

- How much missing data in each variable, 

- How wide each distribution is, and
    - The range

- The shape of each distribution
    - Std Dev: platykurtic vs leptokurtic

<br>

### Why might you consider including a summary statistics table in your second paper?

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## 1. Tables {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

```{r}
d_afg <- d |>
  filter(Country == "Afghanistan")

tibble(
  Physint_sum = c("All Obs", "Afghanistan"),
  N = c(nrow(d), nrow(d_afg)),
  Mean = c(mean(d$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE), mean(d_afg$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE)),
  Std_Dev = c(sd(d$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE), sd(d_afg$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE)),
  Min = c(min(d$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE), min(d_afg$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE)),
  Max = c(max(d$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE), max(d_afg$`Physical Integrity Rights Index`, na.rm = TRUE))
) |>
  kbl(digits = 1, align = c('l', rep('c', 5))) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), font_size = 40) |>
  column_spec(1:6, width = '8em')
```

::: notes

Here I'm showing you the summary stats for all countries scores in `Physical Integrity Rights Index` and comparing it to the average scores for Afghanistan.

### What does this comparison help us to see about Afghanistan?

<br>

(The summary stats on ALL of the data gives the reader the context for interpreting your country's average scores)

- e.g. Where does your country fit in the world's scores?

<br>

### Questions on using Tables in data analysis?

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 5, 1))
```

::::

::: notes

When summarizing a categorical variable you are limited basically to counting its level.

- These counts can then be presented as either a table or bar plot

<br>

While the PTS scores are presented as numbers in the spreadsheet, each actually represents a distinct category of "political terror"

- It is risky to assume the differences between each category is the same (e.g. moving from level 1 to level 2 may not be as "big" as a move from level 4 to level 5).

<br>

Here I hope you see that a bar plot is much more useful visualization tool than the table.

<br>

### Any obvious conclusions about Afghanistan over this period according to this analysis?

## 3. Line Plots {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.asp=0.618, fig.align='center', out.width = '80%', fig.width=7}
## line plot physint across time
d |>
  filter(Country == "Afghanistan", Year < 2016) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Physical Integrity Rights Index`)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linewidth = 1.3) +
  ggthemes::theme_clean() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Physical Integrity Rights Index",
       title = "Physical Integrity Rights in Afghanistan (2011-2015)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,8)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2015, 1))
```

::: notes

Line plots are a a useful technique for visualizing a single variable across time.

- Preferable if the data is numeric, but not totally  misleading if applied to categories like `Physical Integrity Rights Index`.

- In Excel highlight the column and insert a line-plot chart

<br>

### Any obvious conclusions from this viz?

:::


## 4. Scatter Plots {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.asp=0.9, fig.align='center', out.width = '55%', fig.width=6}
## scatter plot 
d |>
  ggplot(aes(x = `Physical Integrity Rights Index`, y = PTS_S)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggthemes::theme_clean() +
  labs(x = "Physical Integrity Rights Index", y = "Political Terror Scale (State Dept)", title = "PTS and V-Dem Broadly Agree with Each Other (2011 - 2024)")
```

::: notes

The last comonly used tool is a scatter plot and is useful for visualizing the relationship between two numeric variables.

- Each point on a scatter plot corresponds to a single observation in the dataset (country-year has this score on each variable)

- Note: I added "jitter" to the points to deal with overplotting

<br>

### Questions on this?

## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

Political Violence Country Briefings

Select **two countries** (no overlapping cases in class) and analyze their recent experience of political violence using **ALL FIVE** of the data sources we explored in class

For **EACH** country you must produce a **TWO PAGE** country briefing report that summarizes and visualizes the findings of your analyses

- 2 countries x 2 pages = 4 pages total

- You should aim to analyze at least the last five years of available data for each country.

::: notes

Ok, so that's your next target.

- These two briefings will be due at the end of Week 9 (Oct 17th)

<br>

**Questions on what we discussed today or the assignment prompt?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: My plan to keep you on track

:::





## Monday, Oct 13th (Week 9) {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

### **Prepare at least three conclusions about EACH country's experience of political violence (with visualizations)**

1. Tables 

2. Bar Plots

3. Line Plots

4. Scatter Plots

::: notes

We will work on these briefings in class during Week 9

- Your task for the first class of that week is to submit the big "conclusions" you've reached about each of your countries

- You will submit to Canvas an explanation of the conclusion and the data visualization you are working on to illustrate it

<br>

In class we'll review them all and give each other feedback

- **Questions on the assignment?**

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

Davenport and Armstrong (2004)

- Submit analysis to Canvas

::: notes

Next week we explore some of the academic literature on why democracies use political violence
