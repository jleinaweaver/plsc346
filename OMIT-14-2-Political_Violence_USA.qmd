For today I assigned you an intriguing argument that I think holds and connects MANY of the political violence arguments from our class into one.

<br>

Arguments like:

- Tilly's work on politics and varieties of collective violence,

- Freedman's work on violence as a strategic act,

- The debate between Weber and Olson over the nature and use of violence by states against their citizens,

- The constraints against violence that vary by regime type and institutions,

- The capacity of small groups to use threats and violence to influence wider populations, and

- The power of information and the internet to forge identities and overcome collective action problems.

<br>

All of this and more is here in this single article!

- Pretty good, right?

Donald Trump came closer than anyone thought he could to toppling a free election a year ago. He is preparing in plain view to do it again, and his position is growing stronger. Republican acolytes have identified the weak points in our electoral apparatus and are methodically exploiting them. They have set loose and now are driven by the animus of tens of millions of aggrieved Trump supporters who are prone to conspiracy thinking, embrace violence, and reject democratic defeat. Those supporters, Robert Pape’s “committed insurrectionists,” are armed and single-minded and will know what to do the next time Trump calls upon them to act.

Democracy will be on trial in 2024. A strong and clear-eyed president, faced with such a test, would devote his presidency to meeting it. Biden knows better than I do what it looks like when a president fully marshals his power and resources to face a challenge. It doesn’t look like this.

I want us to organize our discussion around the arguments Gellman nicely summarizes at the very end of his article.

Everybody go to the end of the piece and find these two paragraphs

- Arguably the conclusion of the paper is the final four mini paragraphs, but we're going to focus on these two.

<br>

These two paragraphs hold the four big conclusions Gellman is working hard to convince you are correct.

<br>

SLIDE: Let's step through and evaluate each of them.

- the CIRIGHTS and PTS projects on the experience of political violence in that country.
]

::: notes

A big part of your project will require you to go back into the data projects we've been exploring all semester.

- We used CIRIGHTS and PTS to help us analyze the experience of violence in specific states across time.

- We used GTD and EDTG to analyze the experience of terrorism in specific states across time.

<br>

### Questions on the second part?

.size70[**For Friday**]

.size45[
Bring to class an example of a specific policy action taken by a state or a non-state actor meant to reduce the occurrence or severity of terrorism in a single country.

- CIRIGHTS (1981-2017)
- PTS (1976-2020)
- GTD (1970-2019)
- EDTG (1970-2016)
]

*Send email*

Let's gather some prospective cases!

- For Friday go find a policy you could organize your paper around and bring it to class so we can share what you've found and where you may take it.

- Aim for timings of the policy that would allow it to be evaluated using our four data projects.
