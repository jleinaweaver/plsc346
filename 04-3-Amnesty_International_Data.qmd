1. Review Canvas submissions

**SLIDE**: Today we continue our work on the first paper...

## Paper 1 {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

Which **SINGLE** data source would you recommend to someone interested in better understanding the use of political violence by governments around the world?

- Your thesis should be a clear recommendation for **ONE** of the sources and should be supported by **AT LEAST THREE distinct reasons** for your recommendation

- **A high quality recommendation** will also make clear **why** you are not recommending the other sources

**Questions on the prompt?**

**Sources of Political Violence Data**
:::

- The US State Department's "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"

- Amnesty International's "Annual Country Reports"

- The Political Terror Scale (PTS)

- The CIRIGHTS data project's "Physical Integrity Rights"

- Varieties of Democracy's (V-Dem) "Personal Integrity Rights"

::: notes

Next week we'll be examining three quantitative data projects: PTS, CIRIGHTS and the V-Dem data

- This will mean lots of Excel (or R for the brave!)

<br>

### Are we ok working in this room or do you want to meet in Springfield Hall's Computer Lab A for next week's classes?

- I like this room for the work it lets us do, but I completely understand if you need a computer station.

Last class we dug deep into the most widely used sources of data for human rights practices around the world, the US State Department's Country Reports.

- We evaluated the operationalization, instrumentation and measurements produced in these reports in order to draw conclusions about their validity and reliability as data

<br>

### First, does anybody have questions or want to clarify the concepts themselves?

- Operationalization: "...selecting observable phenomena to represent abstract concepts" (89).
    - To be useful must be precise and explicit

- Instrumentation: Convert your operationalization (definition) into a series of steps you can use to measure the concept in question

- Measurement: Applying the instrument to the cases to generate values/data/numbers

<br>

This is essentially how any quantitative research project is designed, implemented and evaluated.

1. How did they operationalize the concept?
    - Is the definition precise and explicit?

2. What instrument(s) did they design?
    - Are they likely to produce valid and reliable data?

3. How was the instrument applied to the cases?

<br>

### What were your big takeaways from evaluating the US State Dept Reports as measures of "human rights practices"?

- *This is directly working on the paper so you don't offer ANYTHING!*

Today we shift to our second source of data on governments using political violence: Amnesty International's "Annual Country Reports"

### Everybody ready to go with these?

<br>

### In broad terms, what did you think of the form and format of the country reports?

- *Save discussion comparing to State Dept reports for end of class*

<br>

Let's start our evaluation of the data with this:

### What is the key concept being measured in these reports?

- (**SLIDE**: Human Rights Practices)

*Split class into groups (4 groups of 5?)*

- Go sit with your groups

<br>

Groups, I want you to use the readings for today to evaluate the measurements produced in the Amnesty Reports

- e.g. the AI FAQ and Clark and Sikkink (2013) 

<br>

Focus on HOW the measures are constructed using this process.

- Work directly on the board and keep track of the strengths and weaknesses you identify along the way

<br>

### Questions on the exercise?

- Get to it!

Notes

Clark and Sikkink (2013) p545-547

- "AI draws on material collected by AI researchers from domestic human rights organizations, other observers, and sometimes on-site missions" (p545).
- "The State Department draws on in-country embassy staff reports in addition to information generated by NGOs and other observers."
- Important caveats for all human rights data:
    - During major episodes it can be hard to know what is going on and how many have been injured
    - Repressive govts often try to hinder NGOs or hide these activities
- Neither source aims to produce data for academic indices so be careful using them as such
- Serious over time differences in each orgs approach: formulas have changed, definitions have changed, level of detail has changed, scope of countries covered has changed, levels of staffing/expertise in a given country also changes over time
- Early AI reports were a brief summary of activities by the group for its members so focused only on places with ongoing problems
- Early State reports were focused on US aid recipients only and some early reports show political biases (see Guatemala reports in early 1980s)
- Information quality has improved for both across time
- Different motivational perspectives: State department tends to focus on the organizational level whereas AI places high value on the life of every individual harmed

Ok, given all of these strengths and weaknesses, what are our takeaways?

### What is our best advice for using these reports to analyze political violence by governments around the world?

### - In other words, how do we access the signal in the AI Reports while minimizing the noise?

<br>

Ok, now each of you take your own best advice.

### What are examples of conclusions in the reports you read for today that you believe are most likely valid and reliable? Why?

- Everybody give me one example from there country cases

<br>

### What are examples of conclusions you might consider lower validity or lower reliability? Why?

- Everybody give me one example from there country cases

Let's end today by comparing the sources.

### Did you prefer reading the AI reports or the State Department reports? Why?

### - Which version was more informative? Why?

<br>

### How consistent are these two sources on each country? How much overlap?

<br>

### How independent are the two sources?

### - In other words, does including both in your analysis increase your confidence or do you get the feeling they read and are influenced by each others' reports?

<br>

### Did anybody learn anything about their countries that surprised them? Challenged a preconceived notion?

<br>

### Did anybody have a country case that changed a great deal between 2020 and 2021?
