**Collins (2021) "A New Wave of Terrorism? A Comparative Analysis of the Rise of Far-Right Terrorism"**

::: notes

Last class we examined Collins (2021) who made the argument Far Right Terrorism (FRT) represents the next "wave" of global terrorism

<br>

### First, what does that mean?

### - What is a "wave" of terrorism?

- David Rapoport’s Modern Waves of Terrorism Theory

- Waves identify "motivations, targets, weapon types, group belongings, ideologies, and reoccurring patterns" that help us understand and, hopefully, address the rise of terrorism

- “The Four Waves of Modern Terrorism” defines a wave as a cycle that takes place over a 40-year time period. Each cycle is dynamic in that it expands and contracts.

- Groups within a particular wave adapt to the exigencies of their time, are aware of the actions of other contemporary terrorist groups in other countries, and are driven by a relentless energy that propels them into violent action. They share a common technological facility, including communications, weaponry, and logistics. Most important, they share a vision that perceives in the ills and abuses of the world the seeds of a revolutionary future.

<br>

### Second, did Collins convince you that FRT is the next "wave"? Why or why not?

1. Methods used:
    - Used GTD data to select cases
    - Mixed-methods case studies: Germany, US, UK and Scandinavia

2. Empirical argument: FRT groups have common "type", "prompting cause" and a "common predominant energy"

**Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS)**

![](Images/13_2-PIRUS_Website.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Today I want us to explore a new dataset that aims to deepen our understanding of the kinds of radicalization pathways that exist in the US

- PIRUS focus is on a specific set of non-state actors who are caught actively pursuing certain ends.

- Hugely ambitious dataset, so let's dig into it!

<br>

My hope is that this exploration will deepen our understanding of the terror threat in the US and allow us to keep exploring this question about FRT being the next "wave."

**PIRUS Sample Selection Process: Website FAQ**
:::

- "How were the data in PIRUS collected and coded?"

- "Is the PIRUS dataset a comprehensive sample of radicalization in the United States?"

- "Is the PIRUS dataset a representative sample of individuals radicalized in the United States?"

- "How much missing data does PIRUS have?"

- "Is PIRUS the definitive source on radicalization in the United States?"

::: notes

Let's start by discussing the data sourcing.

- Take a look at these sections in the [FAQ page](https://www.start.umd.edu/pirus-frequently-asked-questions) on their website (linked through Canvas)

<br>

Groups, discuss and get ready to report back your evaluation of their process.

- How confident should we be in the sample selection?

- How representative is the sample likely to be?

<br>

Ok groups:

### Where does the data come from and how confident are we in their sample selection process?

<br>

Based on all these concerns, Groups, get ready to give me two research questions:

1. A research question we could answer with this data, and

2. A research question we couldn't answer

<br>

Report Back

<br>

NOTES

- "PIRUS includes a sample of individuals espousing Islamist, far right, far left, or single-issue ideologies who have radicalized within the United States to the point of committing ideologically motivated illegal violent or non-violent acts, joining a designated terrorist organization, or associating with an extremist organization whose leader(s) has/have been indicted of an ideologically motivated violent offense" (p6).

:::

::: notes

Groups, now open the codebook and review the inclusion criteria

- Get ready to report back on the strengths and weaknesses of their process to decide who does and does not get included in the dataset

<br>

**Ok, what do we think of their inclusion criteria?**

- **Strengths and weaknesses?**

<br>

**Based on this inclusion criteria are there some research questions we should NOT try to answer with this data?**

<br>

NOTES

Inclusion Criteria (p8-9)

Summary: In order to be eligible for inclusion, each individual must meet one of the following five criteria:

1. the individual was arrested;
2. the individual was indicted of a crime;
3. the individual was killed as a result of his or her ideological activities;
4. the individual is/was a member of a designated terrorist organization; or
5. the individual was associated with an extremist organization whose leader(s) or founder(s) has/have been indicted of an ideologically motivated violent offense.

In addition, each individual MUST:

1. have been radicalized in the United States,
2. have espoused or currently espouse ideological motives, and
3. show evidence that his or her behaviors are/were linked to the ideological motives he or she espoused/espouses.

![](Images/13_2-PIRUS_Tool.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The search tool on the PIRUS webpage is quite powerful.

- I assume everybody spent some time playing with this before class

<br>

Let's start our exploration with our question about "waves" of terrorism.

### What can use here to help us answer Collins' question about the rise of FRT?

- (Pretty clearly by the Ideology bar plot, the super-majority of radicals in PIRUS are categorized as "Far-Right")

<br>

### Given everything we discussed about the design of this data project, how confident are we in using this to draw inferences about radicalization in the US as a whole?

### - In other words, is this convincing evidence that the biggest domestic terror threat we face is from the far-right? Why or why not?

<br>

So, we see the US has a lot more Far-Right radicals than other groups, but is that changing across time?

- **SLIDE**: Unfortunately, I don't see an easy way to control for time in the web search tool

::: notes

Here is a line plot that counts radicals in the dataset by their ideology and year of exposure

- This is the "year (YYYY) in which the individual’s activity/plot first came to public attention. This is usually time of incident or arrest, or earliest mention of individual in sources, so long as these are related to the plot/radicalization of the individual" (p11).

<br>

### What do we see here in terms of trands across time?

<br>

### Again, given all the caveats in the dataset's design are we confident saying that the US shows evidence of a "wave" in FRT? Why or why not?

<br>

Let's dive back into the web tool and see what else we can learn about radicalization in the US using the PIRUS dataset.

::: notes

The top map is our usual count but the bottom is scaled by the population in each state.

<br>

### Compare and contrast the maps for me

### - What do we learn from the remade map (scaling for population)?

<br>

The danger here is that simple counts essentially come to represent population

- e.g. bigger states have more radicals because they have more people

- The problem isn't necessarily that CA has a problem with radicals but more that because CA is HUGE it has some of every kind of people.

<br>

The question of which map is appropriate depends on the research question you are trying to answer OR the model you are trying to test

### For what kinds of research questions do we prefer the first map?

<br>

### For what kinds of research questions do we prefer the second?

**Do these rescaled maps tell a different story than simple counts?**

<br>

**What do we learn about the locations and sizes of ideological extremes in this country?**

<br>

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the web tool allows you to make these adjustments and that is incredibly disappointing.

- This is one of the BIG reasons your ability to do useful data science depends on building your own visualizations, ideally using a real statistical tool

- If all you have is the web tool then you are stuck making the pictures they pre-designed for you and you may not even realize they misrepresent what you are trying to do.

### Questions on this?

### What do we learn about the groups active in Missouri?

Click on Missouri (or filter observations to MO) and tell me about the characteristics of these groups.

One of the big fears that gets spread frequently in the media is that of foreign terrorists "infiltrating" the US to do harm

- e.g. the panic at our southern border

- **SLIDE**: Check residency status

### **Compare and contrast observations by 'Residency_Status'**

Do extremists differ in levels of violence pursued?

- 'Violent'
    
- 'Primary_Event_Mass_Casualty_Incident'
