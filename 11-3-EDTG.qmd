Measuring "Terrorism"

- The Extended Data on Terrorist Groups (EDTG)

Prep for Class

1. Review submissions on Canvas

2. Readings

    - Hou, D., Gaibulloev, K., & Sandler, T. (2020). Introducing , 1970 to 2016. Journal of Conflict Resolution, 64(1), 199–225.

<br>

*Split class into small groups (ONLY 2-3 per group for presenting)*

- Go sit with your group.

<br>

Today I want us to examine the Extended Data on Terrorist Groups (EDTG) database.

- This is a project born from concerns about the RAND data and building on the work of the GTD.

- The data is on our LMS and at 10k rows, Excel should be able to handle it easily.

<br>

Groups, make sure everybody has the data downloaded and opened in Excel (Web or Desktop version).

Before we dig in, let's discuss the critique of RAND in the article for today.

<br>

**What are the three critiques raised by these authors of the RAND Database (p202)?**

- (SLIDE)

![](Images/11-2-rand.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

1. No updates after 2007 (now 2009?)

2. Only domestic attacks since 1998

3. Only "significant" events

::: notes

**What does this mean for anybody who uses Rand as their primary source for measuring terrorism around the world?**

- *DISCUSS*

<br>

- SUPER weird that these notes aren't clear on the RAND website. 
    - If true, these are incredibly important caveats to using their database.

**Extended Data on Terrorist Groups (EDTG)**

<br>

What is the goal of this project?
:::

::: notes

Talk to me about the bona fides of the EDTG project.

<br>

### What is the goal of the project?

- "To understand terrorism and its drivers, researchers must investigate terrorist groups’ characteristics and actions that create casualties, achieve demands, determine base location, and affect their longevity. Knowledge of those things can foster more effective counter-terrorism measures to limit terrorist groups’ carnage, political consequences, and economic ramifications" (200).

<br>

What are the pros and cons of using this as our primary database of terrorism?

::: notes

**What are the pros and cons of adopting this as our primary database of terrorism?**

- Groups discuss and then report back!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

Pros:

- Rooted in established GTD project approaches
- Draws on expertise/experience/findings from three major projects
    - International Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events (ITERATE; Mickolus et al. 2018)
    - Global Terrorism Database (GTD; National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism [START] 2018)
    - RAND Database of Worldwide Terrorism Incidents (RAND 2012)
- Includes MANY key measures to describe terror groups by bases, ideology, aims, etc.

Cons:

- Year-Group dyad is somewhat limiting for capturing group characteristics. Can we say these groups are stable on these characteristics within a single year?
- Are dummy variables appropriate for these complicated questions? Is it really so easy to identify the "ideology" or "aims" of diverse groups of non-state actors in fluid organizations using dummy variables?
- What does "size" actually mean? How do you officially "join" a group?

<br>

The danger is that this dataset implies a high level of accuracy in terms of describing these groups, e.g. 0s vs 1s on most measures. 

- Is that merited?

**Who are the domestic terror groups currently active in the USA? (2016)**

::: notes

Let's practice navigating the dataset.

- Groups, turn on the filter for the data and identify the terror groups in 2016 with a base in the US.

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

```{r, results='asis'}
## How many cases with the US as one of the bases?
d_usa <- d[str_detect(d$base, pattern = "U.S."),] |>
  filter(year == 2016)

## Extract group names
usa_names <- d_usa |> select(gname)

## Build table of those groups and years covered
d |>
  filter(gname %in% usa_names[[1]]) |>
  group_by(gname) |>
  summarize(
    min = min(year),
    max = max(year)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    Period = str_c(min, " - ", max),
    min = NULL,
    max = NULL
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kbl() |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width = '18em')
```

::: notes

**Did everybody find these five terror groups?**

- Note that "U.S." isn't always the first country in the list of base countries.
    - Is this a "con" for the dataset?

<br>

### Are we to assume this means there are only five terror groups based in the US in 2016?

- Per their case selection criteria, yes.
- Groups must have committed an attack

<br>

### Scan across the data for these groups ACROSS TIME, what do we learn about them?

**Ok, talk to me about these groups and the experience of domestic terrorism in the US.**

- **What do we learn from this?**

### Do these results paint an accurate picture of US based terrorism? Why or why not?

Let's go global now!

- I want each group to claim one terror group that was active in 2016 
    - No overlap!

- Take some time to review the data about that group and get ready to introduce it to the class.

- **SLIDE**: Details of the job...

**Use the EDTG to brief us on an active terrorist group**

- **Active Period**: year, duration
- **Bases**: base, num_base, mul_bases
- **Location**: EAP, ECA, LAC, MENA, NA, SAS, SSA
- **Attacks**: total_atks, total_injuries, total_casualties, total_deaths
- **Ideology**: left, nat, rel, right
- **Size**: size, peak_size
- **Aims**: ercsr, pch, sq, tch
- **Global Impact**: shr_trans, num_allies, num_rivals, num_enemies, 
- **Structure**: terrctrl, lead_hierarch, drugtk, kidnap, state_sponsor, social_service, public_service
- **Ending**: endstr, fate_leader

::: notes

Introduce your case to us along all these groupings.

As you review your case I want you to think carefully about the validity and reliability of these measures.

- How complete a picture of this group do these variables give us?

<br>

Let's hear what you found! Introduce us to your group.

<br>

### Bottom line, is the EDTG our best choice for studying terrorism? Why or why not?

### Are we convinced these new measures are both valid and reliable? Why or why not?

<br>

duration: The duration in years of a terrorist group’s existence since its formation.

base: The base countries of a terrorist group.

total_atks: This variable indicates the number of attacks that a terrorist group launched in a given year.

Types of group
+ left (left wing)
+ nat (nationalist/separatist)
+ rel (religious)
+ right (right wing)

size: The strength of a terrorist group.

peak_size: The largest size that a terrorist group achieved.

Types of goal
+ ercsr: seeks an empire, regime-change, or social-revolution goal.
+ pch: a policy-change goal

+ tch: seeks a territorial-change goal

total_deaths: The total number of deaths caused by a terrorist group in a given year.

total_injuries: The total number of injuries caused by a terrorist group in a given year.

total_casualties: The total number of deaths and injuries caused by a terrorist group in a given year.

endstr: categories for how the group ended

drugtk: This dummy variable indicates whether a terrorist group traffics in drugs and/or grows or supplies drugs.

kidnap: This dummy variable indicates whether a terrorist group engages in kidnappings in a given year.

state_sponsor: This dummy variable indicates whether a terrorist group has been provided with any kind of support by states in a given year.
