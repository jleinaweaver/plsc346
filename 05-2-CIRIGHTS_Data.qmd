1. Review Canvas submissions

**SLIDE**: Today we continue our work on the first paper...

## Paper 1 {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

Which **SINGLE** data source would you recommend to someone interested in better understanding the use of political violence by governments around the world?

- Your thesis should be a clear recommendation for **ONE** of the sources and should be supported by **AT LEAST THREE distinct reasons** for your recommendation

- **A high quality recommendation** will also make clear **why** you are not recommending the other sources

::: notes

**Questions on the prompt?**

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Sources of Political Violence Data**
:::

- The US State Department's "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"

- Amnesty International's "Annual Country Reports"

- **The Political Terror Scale (PTS)**

- The CIRIGHTS data project's "Physical Integrity Rights"

- Varieties of Democracy's (V-Dem) "Personal Integrity Rights"

::: notes

Last class we explored the Political Terror Scale (PTS)

### Key takeaways? 

### - e.g. elements of validity and reliability arguments that stood out for you?

### - How do the PTS scores supplement your reading/analysis of the source docs?

<br>

+ PTS represents expert codings by area experts (right?) with reliability checks built-in. Using these measures backs up YOUR analysis of the source docs. It's not just you interpreting them this way but backed by experts!

+ PTS enables and facilitates comparisons, but not just across countries. Your reports analyze a single country across time which is a comparison exercise. You are comparing your country to itself each year through time!

+ BUT as we noted PTS is limited. 
    + Five point scale but is it safe to assume that holds for all people in the country? White dude watching TV vs LGBTQ+ person in a protest against the government?
    + PTS focuses pretty narrowly on government violence of a particular type. Leaves out much we might argue is important to measuring political violence.

**Exploring the CIRIGHTS Data Project**

1. Evaluate the codebook

2. Evaluate the data

:::

::: notes

**Everybody ready for today's work?**

<br>

Before we dive into the data we have to evaluate its validity and reliability.

### So, let's begin in this same place we've begun with the other sources, what is the concept the CIRIGHTS project is trying to measure?

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**"...government respect for human rights (p2)"**
:::

![](Images/05-2-CIRIGHTS_Logo.png)

::: notes

**And why is this their focus? What is their primary data source?**

- (The US State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices!)
    - Although, note on p1 that they also use AI reports for the "Personal Integrity Rights" scores

<br>

Everybody open up the ToC in the CIRIGHTS codebook.

<br>

As you can see in the codebook's ToC the CIRIGHTS project divides "respect for human rights" into four broad categories

- Moving forward we'll be focusing on the "Physical integrity rights" index which I think makes the most sense given our work on Monday's cases.

- However, in thinking about your group definitions of political violence...

### Are there other measures listed here that might be useful measures of political violence? Why or why not?

### - Maybe an element from the Empowerment Rights Index?

- Foreign Movement, 
- Domestic Movement, 
- Freedom of Speech, 
- Freedom of Assembly & Association, Workersâ€™ Rights, Electoral Self-Determination, and Freedom of Religion indicators

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's unpack the "Physical integrity rights"

Let's now audit the data.

- Everybody focus on the two countries you've been analyzing this week and last.

### Would you have coded these the same way? Why or why not?

<br>

### Findings? Takeaways?

#### - Which variables seem the easiest to code / we have the most confidence in?

#### - Which the least?

<br>

### Open it up to the class: What did you find or notice when exploring the dataset?

### - Show us something cool!

- *Let them lead this and after a while feel free to segue to your slides*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's continue to audit the data

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

### Any missing data issues in the 2022 "Physical Integrity Rights Index"?]

- e.g. selection bias

::: notes

Let's dig into the data.

- REMEMBER, our key exercise here is to analyze the validity and reliability of the measures SO THAT later we can use them to analyze country behavior.

<br>

Use the autofilter to zoom in on 2022 only

- Then scroll through and talk to me about the kinds of countries with missing data in any of the three measures.

::: notes

This stacked bar plot represents country scores as a proportion out of 100%

- Here we see the breakdown of scores per violence tool

<br>

This is a staggering result for torture!

- `r tab1$n[tab1$Measure == "Torture" & tab1$Values == 0]` countries torture frequently (out of `r nrow(d2022)`)

- `r sum(tab1$n[tab1$Measure == "Torture" & tab1$Values %in% c(0,1)])` countries torture 'frequently' or 'occasionally'!

- That's `r sum(tab1$n[tab1$Measure == "Torture" & tab1$Values %in% c(0,1)])/nrow(d2022)*100`%!

<br>

### Any hypotheses as to why torture is the most common form of government violence?

::: notes

Annoying that CIRIGHTS scores work on the inverse to PTS.

- I prefer measures to increase with "more" of the name of the variable
    - e.g. higher torture score should mean more torture
    
- But they didn't ask us so this is what we have (unless we recode it!)

<br>

### What do we learn from comparing and contrasting these global scores?

<br>

### - Any surprises?

### - Lessons for us re reliability / validity?

**What do we think of the scores for the US over time?**

<br>

### Any idea where this data comes from if not from the State Department?

- Must be AI?

**Exploring the V-Dem "Personal Integrity Rights" Scores**

1. Evaluate the methodology / codebook

2. Evaluate the data

:::

::: notes

For Friday we repeat today's work on the CIRIGHTS data project.

Get ready to work!

The V-Dem Varieties of Democracy "Personal Integrity Rights"
- FILE 1: V-Dem/V-Dem-CY-Core_csv_v13/codebook_v13.pdf
- FILE 2: V-Dem/V-Dem-CY-Core_csv_v13/V_Dem_Personal_Integrity_Rights-2022.xlsx

Syllabus Tasks
1. Review the V-Dem Varieties of Democracy Codebook *ONLY p30, 32-34, 40-42, 176-178*

2. Audit the "Personal Integrity Rights" scores for your country cases from last week

3. Spend some time exploring the dataset and find us something interesting to discuss

Have the average rates for the types of violations varied across time?

Remember, lower values are bad!

##

Focus on the scores for total index score in the years since 2001 and find us other examples of countries that have:

  + Improved the most, and
  
  + Regressed the most across the years in the sample
