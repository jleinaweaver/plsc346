Prep for Class

1. Review submissions on Canvas

<br>

*For you: this is a paper about how social media can be used to overcome the collective action problem and coming to see your in-group as supportive of violence against the out-group*

- Not all collective action problems are bad!!!

<br>

Last class we used case studies of the internet changing the nature of terrorism to design research proposals.

<br>

Today we shift our focus to a recent research paper that executes on a proposal interested in this same interaction

- This is SUCH a COOL paper

- They are able to design a natural experiment that lets us untangle a big set of claims

**"Fanning the Flames of Hate: Social Media and Hate Crime"**

<br>

**Evaluate the Framing**

1. Research question

2. Key concepts

3. Connections to the literature

:::

::: notes

Let's start by exploring the framing of the article.

- GROUPS, take a few minutes and get ready to share your thoughts about the framing of this research paper

- Think BIG PICTURE, e.g. how the researchers set up their project

<br>

### What is the research question and what do we learn from its phrasing?
- (Does social media "propagate" hate crimes?)
    - propagate: spread and promote (an idea, theory, etc.) widely.
    
<br>

I want to talk for a second about the implied mechanism here.

### Are the authors arguing that social media changes peoples' positions on important topics?

### - e.g. a regular person going about their day sees a Hitler meme on Facebook and decides to firebomb a synagogue?

- (Not exactly. The idea here is more that we all have predispositions to certain ideas and social media can help spark those preferences into action)

<br>

Think of it like the effect of advertising on your behavior as a consumer.

- If you're in the market for a car, you'll start to notice and respond to car ads

- If you're not, you probably just ignore them

<br>

I bring this up in our framing discussion to make clear that this paper doesn't require us to assume people are stupid.

- e.g. I read about Jewish space lasers on the internet and now I believe!

::: notes

Prior research has worked to demonstrate a correlation between social media use and concerning real-world outcomes

- Social media platforms allow users to easily self-select into niche topics and extreme viewpoints, e.g. echo chambers

<br>

Prior research has also shown that "traditional media can play a role in violent outbursts or ethnic hatred (e.g Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014; Adena et al., 2015; DellaVigna et al., 2014)."

- Evidence for the coordination of incidents as a plausible mechanism

<br>

Key here for this paper is the attempt to connect the two

- Social media has become a widely-consumed news source, particularly for young people (Hölig and Hasebrink, 2016)

- In the US, around half of all adults use social media to get news and two thirds of Facebook users use it as a news source (Pew Research Center, 2018).

<br>

So, social media may now be capable of the kinds of violence seen through media channels

<br>

I know the paper dives into the empirics before discussing the model, but I want us to stay on track with our more standard approach

- We are very much trying to reinforce the process of science and research in your minds

<br>

- Research question leads to a specific literature,

- Literature and intuition produces a theory,

- Theory produces testable implications, and

- Testable implications can be examined with data

<br>

### Any questions on this general process?

**Potential Mechanisms**

1. Information Exchange

2. Persuasion

3. Coordination

4. Local Spillovers

:::

::: notes

Section 3.6 proposes four "potential mechanisms" connecting social media and hate crimes

### Explain each one of these to me.

### - Don't focus on what they found in the analysis yet, just clarify each story for us.

<br>

- Information Exchange: People learn about locations of refugees on social media

- Persuasion: People’s opinion about refugees is changed by social media

- Coordination: Attacks against refugees are coordinated on social media

- Local Spillovers: Social media inspire copy-cat attacks

<br>

### Everybody clear on these four mechanisms?

<br>

Alright, lets' translate these into our usual diagram of interests, institutions and interactions

- Go!

<br>

*Report Back!*

<br>

**SIDE**: My version

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center .smaller}

**Interests**

- Non-state actors &rarr; To harm the out-group (refugees)

**Institutions**

- Domestic law strongly forbids hate crimes and makes these actions costly

**Interactions**

- Social media can overcome the collective action problem (willingness to break the law) by:
    - Providing location **information** for refugees,
    - **Persuading** these actors that the threat is real, serious and shared
    - **Coordinating** the group's future actions, and
    - Demonstrating the in-group is willing to use violence (**local spillovers**)

::: notes

Fundamentally, as discussed at the bottom of p4, this is about:

1. Overcoming collective action problems, and 

2. Learning that your in-group is supportive of violence against the out-group.

<br>

### What do we think of the model? 

### - Logical and persuasive or not?

<br>

I want to return for a sec to our framing discussion at the start

- This model is NOT about social media brainwashing the innocent

- This model is about social media providing the boost that pushes a person who is open to violence across the line

- This is scary and WAY harder to police

<br>

Let's talk data!

### What is the key outcome the paper is trying to explain?
- (**SLIDE**)

**Anti-Refugee Incidents**

- Source: Amadeu Antonio Foundation and Pro Asyl (pro asylum NGO)

- All incidents geo-coded for location (municipality)

- 3,335 incidents (Jan 2015 - Feb 2017)
:::
::::

::: notes

The key outcome here is the variation in "incidents" against refugees

- 2,226 incidents of property damage to refugee homes, 

- 534 cases of assault, 

- 339 incidents during anti-refugee protests, and 

- 225 cases of arson

<br>

### Why do the authors argue this is "high quality" data? (2137)

1. Each entry has a clearly indicated source.
    - Nearly half of the incidents in the dataset are reported by the federal government in response to inquiries by the left-wing party “Die Linke.” 
    - Other sources include police reports and national or local media outlets. 

2. We hand-checked a random sample of 100 incidents and found their coding accurately reflected the information reported in the respective source.

<br>

### What are the key predictors the paper is using to explain these outcomes?

**Facebook Data**

    - Many posts exhibit clearly negative language towards refugees

::: notes

**Everybody clear on the first predictor?**

<br>

### Any concerns about the validity and reliability of this kind of sentiment coding?

<br>

### - According to the researchers, what problem do they have with flagging all posts that mention refugees (p2139)?

- "A potential downside of this approach is that we may inadvertently tag posts that do not express negative sentiments towards refugees. However, a careful content analysis of posts and comments reveals that the overwhelming majority appear to agree with the positions of the AfD. This is perhaps unsurprising given that only people who “like” the AfD Facebook page will be informed about new posts. Critics, on the other hand, have a strong incentive not to indicate publicly that they “like” the party" (2139).

<br>

I do wish they had undertaken a broader analysis of their own data to be more certain that "refugee" is always negative in their data

- Although it really does seem like a very safe bet

**Facebook Data**

- Source: Facebook page for the AfD

- 93k individuals: 176k posts, 290k comments, 510k likes

- Predictor 1: Anti-refugee sentiment

- Predictor 2: Number of AfD users in municipality
:::
::::

::: notes

P2: We use the number of AfD users in a municipality as the a proxy for the exposure to anti-refugee content

- So, the idea here is that anti-refugee comments on Facebook in municipalities with more AfD members = violence

<br>

### Make sense?

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/14_1-Figure2.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Alright, let's talk about Figure 2!

**What does this line plot show us?**

- **x and y axes?**

<br>

Figure 2:

- The total number of AfD Facebook page posts about refugees and the number of antirefugee incidents across time

- "Weeks with more refugee posts also tend to have more antirefugee events."

- "Both series clearly spike during salient events related to refugees, such as Angela Merkel’s widely reported statement “Wir schaffen das” (“We can do this”) during a press conference on the challenges of the refugee situation. 

- A simple time series regression of refugee attacks on AfD posts yields a R2 of
0.34 (unreported).

<br>

### Is this evidence that the model is useful? Why or why not?

- What we have here is a highly suggestive correlation, not evidence of causation

- In addition, this is not a clear test of the specific mechanisms raised in the model (overcoming collective action, in-group sentiments about violence)

<br>

### How do the authors try to establish a causal effect of social media and violence?

- (**SLIDE**: Internet outages as a natural experiment!)

**Internet Outages**

1. Internet Outages > 24 hours, wide impact (Source: Heise.de)

2. Facebook Outages: 8 weeks of major Facebook outages
:::
::::

::: notes

This is pretty darn clever!

- If Facebook is the coordinating mechanism that pushes people over the edge, and

- We have data on AfD users in each municipality, and

- We have data on when the internet wasn't working in a municipality...

<br>

We can try to explain antirefugee incidents in districts with similar numbers of AfD members but compare no internet to with internet.

<br>

### Make sense?

![](Images/14_1-Fig4.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Figure 4 represents our baseline understanding of the relationship

- Here we see the relationship between the number of refugee posts in a municipality and the probability of an attack on refugees

- On the left, only the municipalities with lots of AfD members

- On the right, only the municipalities with small numbers of AfD members

<br>

### Is everybody clear on how to read this visualization?

### - What does each point represent?

### - What does the dashed line represent?

<br>

### So, what do we learn from this?

- (The AfD is a violent organization!)
    - Terrorism anyone?
    
:::




## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/14_1-Fig5b.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Figure 5b is the key to establishing a causal relationship.

<br>

### What do we learn from this?

- When you turn off the internet or Facebook, the violence caused by AfD members plummets AND is no longer related to the number of angry facebook posts nationwide!

- "To establish causality, we exploit exogenous variation in major internet and Facebook outages, which fully undo the correlation between social media and hate crime."

<br>

### Questions on this?

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/14_2-Muller2021-Conclusions1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The authors argue that their test, and others we didn't have time to get into today, support only some of their proposed mechanisms

<br>

They discard "information exchange" because the posts they reviewed showed that location information was only common in references to politicians and crimes that already happened

- Not used to identify refugee targets

<br>

They discard "persuasion" because it seems wildly unlikely that someones' xenophobia would turn off like a light switch when the internet goes out.

- People’s attitudes do not change on a week-to-week basis

<br>

They find additional support for the coordination mechanism in one of the regressions that examines the number of perpetrators to a crime

- Social media posts tend to produce crimes by groups of AfD members, not lone wolf attacks

<br>

They also find support for spillover attacks using a regression that focuses on crimes in neighboring municipalities

- Just like the research on war being contagious, they find that AfD crimes tend to inspire neighboring municipality crimes

### Brainstorming a research question that explores the intersection between terrorism and the internet

Canvas Assignment: Brainstorming a Research Question

Reflect on our work this week exploring the intersection of terrorism and the internet in order to generate a research question that would lead to a useful research project (if a refresher is needed, see the Baglione chapter on research questions or re-read Huntington-Klein ch2).

1. What is your proposed research question?
2. Explain how that question can be answered, and
3. Explain how having that "answer will improve your understanding of how the world works" (3+ sentences)

<br>

A big part of establishing causality vs correlation is to argue you have controlled for all of the relevant confounders in your model.

**Explain to me which of these you believe are confounders in the key relationship?**

- **e.g. alternative explanations considered?**

(Controls: We further find that the effect does not hold for sentiment unrelated to refugees; increases with user network interactions; and decreases with distracting news events.)
