Now that you've had time to reflect on our debate I'd like you to talk to me about it for a moment.

<br>

First, let's talk costs and benefits

### What are the biggest possible benefits of embracing universal jursidiction?

### What are the most likely costs of doing so?

<br>

Second, does perspective matter for your recommendation?

### In other words, do the costs and benefits balance differently depending on where you stand in the international system?

### - Big states vs small states vs ngos vs people living under a dictatorship?

Today we'll explore the idea of a Responsibility to Protect (R2P) as a strategy for reducing government violence against its citizens

### Somebody define R2P for us.

*Solicit multiple definitions, discuss*

::: notes

R2P gets "enshrined" during the World Summit at the UN in 2005.

- Here's the most relevant section from the "Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 16 September 2005."

Everybody take a moment to read and reflect on what this says.

### Based on this statement, what version of R2P has any consensus on the world stage.

(SLIDE: Discussion notes on next slide)

*DISCUSSION NOTES*

<br>

Big caveats!
- Responsibility MUST be channeled through the UN
- Actions must be consistent with UN Charter and international law.
- Diplomatic, humanitarian and peaceful means required as first try
- "Collective action" only on case-by-case basis when the peaceful stuff has failed and through the powers of the UN SC (which already has this power)
- Final sentence indicates in favor of capacity building and trying to head off crises before they begin.
- R2P only appears in preceding section focused on how each state has an R2P for its own people only.

HOWEVER, don't assume this adds up to nothing.
- States here acknowledging the principal
- States accepting R2P binds on every state
- Opens path for UNSC to interfere in domestic politics!

### Any questions on all this?

.size60[.center[**Responsibility to Protect (R2P)**]]

.size40[
Under what specific criteria, or in response to what specific situations, do you believe an absolute R2P binds the US to act? 

By "act" I mean:

+ Even if we have to act alone, and

+ That action requires the sacrifice of blood and treasure.
]

::: notes

I want to attack this a little differently than UJ.

Everybody take 10 minutes on your own to describe the kind of situation or crisis or act of violence that you believe requires us to act.

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

## Notes from class 2019-10-11

- acts of genocide vs genocide
- duration of the conflict matters
- Pattern of abuse required
- breaking int'l law
- US regional allies impacted
- US citizens threatened
- Never alone
- High likelihood of success required

.size45[
1. We are never obligated to act (always a choice)

2. We are obligated to act only for the absolute worst cases

3. We are obligated by R2P on our own when the UN fails to act
]

::: notes

Ideally, I'd like to make sure we hear a version of at least three different positions today.

Key here is that we mean a significant, legal version of "obligation."

- e.g. your family is the victim of a genocide and the US failed to act which gives you the right to press for significant monetary damages in US courts.

<br>

### Which of these comes closest to your personal position? Why?

<br>

### Is there a position I didn't anticipate that needs to be added?
