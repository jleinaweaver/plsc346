**Define "Political Violence"**
:::

::: notes

Last class we set up our semester by talking big picture-wise about politics and violence.

### What were your takeaways about this concept that is central to our work this semester?

<br>

### And what is the key assumption I want us to use when building models of political violence this semester?
- (**SLIDE**)

**Violence is a political strategy by rational, goal-seeking actors**

**Why am I asking us to use this assumption? **

- **How does it help us?**

- **How is it problematic?**

<br>

### Any questions on what we covered last class?

<br>

Today I want us to explore another baseline concept in our fundamental assumption: Strategy

- This is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but probably not in a precise way very often.

<br>

**SLIDE**: To start I want us to play a game I assume almost all of you have played with me already in International Relations.

:::




## Game: Survive or Die! {background-image="Images/background-red.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
+ Starting Lives: **1** (playing card)

+ Duel: Rock-paper-scissors, winner takes **ONE** card

+ If you are challenged you **MUST** duel

+ If you run out of cards you're **dead** (sit down)

+ Survival requires **3 cards** and survivors split a pool of **extra credit points**
:::

::: notes

*Make sure everybody has one playing card*

**SLIDE** x 5 for the rules

<br>

At the end of the game, the survivors will split a pool of EC points.

- This means, the fewer the survivors the more points each one gets.

<br>

### Any questions on the game?

- Everybody stand up and let's go!

- Ok, back to your seats.

<br>

#### Notes

- FOR YOU: Keep points pool secret (not important). 

- survivors (points) 
    - 1 (3pts), 
    - 2-5 (2 pts), 
    - 6+ (1pt)

## Game: Survive or Die! {background-image="Images/background-red.png" .center}

<br>

**Reflections on the Game**

::: {.incremental}

1) What was your goal for the game and how did you try to achieve it?

2) What was the goal of your classmates in this game and how did they try to achieve them?

:::

::: notes

Time to gather some data.

- Everybody take two minutes on your own to reflect on the game and get ready to answer this question.

- Jot some thoughts down!

<br>

**REVEAL**: Now do it again but focused on your perception of your classmates

- Take some notes, make your ideas concrete by writing them down.

<br>

Let's talk about your experience of answering these two questions.

### 1. Did anybody have trouble answering the first question? Why or why not?

### - Be honest, did you have a clear goal and tactical plan in mind when we started?

<br>

### 2. Which of your two answers is more detailed / longer? Why?

### - How difficult did you find answering the second question? Why or why not?
- Be careful because ease does not mean accuracy! Stereotypes are easy!

<br>

### 3. If you compare and contrast your two answers, how different are they? 

### - What does it mean if they are similar? 

### - What does it mean if they are different?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Alright, we're on our way to defining "strategy" so now let's root this in history!

GROUPS: In ten minutes I want two things up on the board from each group.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Question 1 connected to Freedman's preface

<br>

**NOTES**

**Chapter 1**

The roots of strategy can be seen in human evolution  

- e.g. deception, coalition formation, the instrumental use of violence

Review of research on chimpanzees shows complex “political” behavior  

- The “roots of politics are older than humanity”  
- Coalition building with payments (food, grooming, mating), and attempts to make up after conflicts  
- “strategic intelligence” evolves “through interactions in a complex social environment”

Shifting back to early humans both ecological and social factors make strategy and politics necessities of survival.  

- Trying to climb a tall tree and sleep safely up there takes planning  
- Living in larger social groups requires empathy, understanding of each others needs, a recognition of established hierarchies, etc.

Strategies of Violence  

- Contrasts ants (genocidal lunatics) with chimpanzees and their much more careful, strategic use of violence  
- Chimpanzee conflicts primarily over resources but groups very careful before engaging in conflict  
- Colonies had very different resource endowments and these power imbalances would lead to conflict  
- Fundamental lesson of strategy: Smart planning could overcome sheer strength

**Chapter 2**

“Best” strategic advice in the Bible: Trust god and obey his laws  

- However, seems that God granted man the power of choice and with it, frequently illustrated in its stories, came deception 
- Much of the Bible is made up of stories of God testing mankind by manipulating our choices  
- Adam and Eve placed in the Garden of Eden with the Tree of Knowledge. Why? To test them! Serpent as subtle and crafty strategist manipulating Eve.

The Ten Plagues as Strategic Coercion  

- Coercive strategy: Using threats to persuade your target to yield  
- Aim is to raise the costs of not complying until they exceed the costs of losing what was currently held  
- Early threats by Moses against Pharaoh were not deemed credible  
- Key to the story is a “turning of the screw” effect or “graduated escalation”  
- Why didn’t Pharaoh concede earlier? 1. Threats that are suspected to be bluffs will frequently be ignored, 2. Moses kept increasing his demands (let the men go pray, let everyone go pray, let everyone bring their stuff and animals), 3. BUT ALSO god hardened Pharaoh’s heart SO THAT HE could demonstrate his power more fully to Egypt!  
- That last point has apparently caused consternation among biblical scholars because it flies in the face of free will which is central to the “choice” god is supposedly giving us to choose a better life

A Coercive Reputation  

- The Israelite march to the promised land offered many additional examples of God’s superior power being leveraged against their enemies and primarily in ways designed to demonstrate God’s power

David and Goliath  

- David’s success depended on speed, surprise and accuracy  
- HOWEVER, it equally depended on David racing up to the fallen Goliath and cutting off his head thus preventing the battle from continuing AND on the Philistines accepting the outcome!

Freedman’s point here is that deception is a strong theme in the Bible  

- Cunning was vital for an underdog to succeed

**Chapter 3**

Odysseus  

- “metis” as strategic intelligence has no direct English translation: to consider, meditate, to plan BUT also to “contrive” or think ahead and anticipate others BUT ALSO deception and trickery  
- Odysseus was a master strategist but also suffered the liars paradox, after a while no one believed him even when telling the truth  
- The Trojan Horse was his idea!

Achilles  

- Contrasted with Odysseus, Achilles represents “bie” brute strength  
- Achilles’ heel: Even the strongest have points of weakness that can be used to bring them down  
- Warnings in the Iliad about: the danger of over-reaching, of using force without intelligent restraint, brute force is not enough

The Method in Metis  

- For Odysseus the ends justified the means  
- Odysseus described as having practical intelligence: he was able to consider “intended actions in the light of anticipated consequences” (28).  
- Sounds like he utilized backwards induction  
- Odysseus understood how others viewed the world and this allowed him to manipulate their thought processes  
- Key is to always try to locate your current actions as part of a longer-term plan

Thucydides  

- Empiricist who tried to write as accurate a history of the Peloponnesian war as possible. Focused on leaders and strategies, not gods and caprice  
- “His narrative illuminated some of the central themes of all strategy: the limits imposed by the circumstances of the time, the importance of coalitions as a source of strength but also instability, the challenge of coping with internal opponents and external pressures simultaneously, the difficulties of strategies that are defensive and patient in the face of demands for quick and decisive offensives, the impact of the unexpected, and--perhaps most importantly--the role of language as a strategic instrument” (30).  
- Thucydides work is much more nuanced than those who simply ascribe him to the Realist paradigm  
- Freedman really goes long in this section…  
- Interesting note from Pericles debate about possible war with Sparta: “If you yield to them you will immediately be required to make another concession which will be greater, since you will have made the first concession out of fear” (33).

Language and Trickery 

- Lots of discussion/historical reference on the power of argument

Plato’s Strategic Coup  

- A striking critique of Sophists, those willing to sell their rhetorical skills to whomever would pay them. These villains lacked any pursuit of truth and instead would shill for any side  
- Freedman argues this critique is rather unfounded (Sophists not really a coherent group and Socrates, Plato’s teacher, shared many of their qualities.

### Define "strategy" as a concept

::: notes

Groups, define strategy for us!

- PRESENT and DISCUSS

<br>

**SLIDE**: Definitions from preface

:::



## Strategy (Freedman 2013) {background-image="Images/background-red.png" .center}

- "...attempts to think about actions in advance, in light of our goals and our capacities" (p.x).

- Identifying objectives and the resources and methods available to meet them (p.xi).

- "It's about getting more out of a situation than the starting balance of power would suggest. It's the art of creating power" (p.xii).

::: notes

Throughout his book, Freedman argues that "strategy" is "ubiquitous" (found everywhere) and has MANY definitions

<br>

Big Idea: Strategy is "much more than a plan? (p.xi)

- A plan: a sequence of moves from one place to another

- A strategy assumes others exist to frustrate your plans. It must be fluid and flexible, rooted to where you actually are.

<br>

### If these are our definitions, was everybody strategic in our Survive or Die game? Why or why not?

::: notes

Groups, define strategy for us!

- PRESENT and DISCUSS

<br>

If being strategic requires planning, goal-seeking and adapting to the other players in any game then we need to discuss rationality.

- I now need everybody to pair off.

- *You assign randomly*

<br>

Let's form two lines with pairs facing each other.

- **SLIDE**: The ultimatum game

:::




## {background-image="Images/01-2-tug_of_war_money.jpg"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Ultimatum Game**
:::

::: notes

Ok, line on my left is player 1.

- P1's take a post-it note and make sure you have something to write with.

<br>

The game is simple: Each pair needs to split five bonus points between you

1. P1 chooses how to divide the points
    - You may choose any division you want but only whole numbers
    - e.g. offer them all 5 or down to nothing, it's up to you!
    - NO PRE-GAME NEGOTIATIONS! No talking!

2. P1 writes down the offer and give paper to P2

3. P2 has a decision to make
    - Accept the offer and the game ends, OR
    - Refuse the offer and BOTH SIDES GET NOTHING

<br>
    
### Is everybody clear on the game?

- Everybody play the game. Go!

<br>

Ok, what happened with each pair?

- *ON BOARD* (2 columns): Offered, Accepted?

:::



## {background-image="Images/01-2-tug_of_war_money.jpg"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Ultimatum Game**
:::

::: notes

Alright, everybody sit down.

- Again, before we talk specifics about this play of the game my interest is on broad strategy in broad strokes!

<br>

### What does it take to play this game "strategically"?

### - Are we only talking about P1 or can P2 be strategic as well? Why or why not?

<br>

### Why didn't all P1's offer only 1 point? 

### - Shouldn't a "rational" player prefer one bonus point to none?

<br>

### What's the lowest you would accept as P2? Why?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Preferences are complicated and likely context dependent!

:::




## {background-image="Images/01-2-multiple_identities.png" .center}

::: notes

Our job as social scientists is to explain the world as it is, not as we wish it was. 
- This means dealing with actors on their own terms, not ours.

- Lots of people have motivations and goals very different from our own.

- Importantly we have to note that

    1. your preference orderings are tied to your identity, AND

    2. You have multiple identities!

<br>

Right now, I'm your professor and I want only the best for you.

- If one of my sons walk in and need something, I'm a dad first and you can all go rot. 

### Make sense?

[**Violence is a political strategy by**]{style="color:darkred;"}

[**rational, goal-seeking actors**]{style="color:darkred;"}

:::

::: notes

Back to our foundational assumption.

### Has recognizing that preferences depend on identity and identity is fluid based on context made our foundational assumption more or less problematic?

- (Hopefully way stronger given that we can adapt to a more dynamic world!)

- Actors have different identities activated by context

- Our assumption might be that your preferences are tied to the identity that is currently activated for you.

<br>

In other words, context matters but can be assumed to be fixed in a given moment.

## Freedman (2013) on Strategy {background-image="Images/background-red.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Strategy is [**fundamental**]{style="color:darkblue;"} to the social world

<br>

Politics in [**everything**]{style="color:darkblue;"}
:::

::: notes

Freedman's book tries to make clear to us that strategy is fundamental to the social world and that there is politics in everything.

- Fundamental features of strategy appear to have evolved and can be seen in chimpanzee behavior
    - e.g. deception, coalition formation, and the instrumental use of violence

- "Strategic intelligence" evolved through interactions in a complex social environment as much as from the demands of survival in a harsh physical environment (p5).

<br>

What are our big takeaways from today?

### 1. What does it mean to be a more strategic actor?

### 2. Are we more or less confident in our foundational assumption that political violence is a strategy?

<br>

(optional)

### Out of curiosity, what proportion of your decisions in your day-to-day life meet this definition of "strategic"? Why?

- Different proportions for different life contexts? Which aspects of your life are you most strategic in? Why?

- Why not be highly strategic in every decision-making situation?

<br>

### Any questions on this?

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

::: notes

Please don't overlap in cases!

- Find something specific e.g. an event that happened on a specific date hopefully with clearly defined actors involved.
