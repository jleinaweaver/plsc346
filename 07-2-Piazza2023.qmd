Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

<br>

Remember, our big goal for this section of the class is to answer this question.

- How and why do governments use violence against the people inside their borders?

<br>

This week we've begun exploring models of of violence by "democratic" states

- **SLIDE**: Davenport and Armstrong

### Davenport, C., & Armstrong, D. A. (2004). Democracy and the Violation of Human Rights: A Statistical Analysis from 1976 to 1996. American Journal of Political Science, 48(3), 538â€“554.

::: notes

Ok, quick refresher on our work from last class!

<br>

**What is the research question in this paper?**

- ("What is the influence, if any, of democracy on repression?" 539)

<br>

**What are the three mechanisms linking democracy and repression that these authors propose?**

1. All Steps Lead to Peace (p540)

2. Some Steps are Better than Others (p541)

3. Steps of Distinction (p542)

<br>

**And which one of these is most consistent with the data?**

- (**SLIDE**)

### Are we convinced this model, the steps of distinction, is the most useful way to think about the relationship between democracy and government violence? Why or why not?

<br>

### What does this model tell us about promoting democracy as a strategy for reducing political violence around the world?

<br>

*SPLIT class into 3 GROUPS*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we examine a different set of mechanisms in a democracy that may be relevant for understanding political violence.

**How does Piazza (2023) frame his research project?**
:::

![](Images/07_1-house_framing.jpg)

::: notes

**Remind me, what does it mean to ask about the "framing" of a research paper?**

<br>

Every research paper represents a set of conclusions about the world.

- e.g. Here's what we know now that we didn't before.

<br>

Every choice you make along the way has a MASSIVE impact on the end product.

- What makes our work "science" is that we are completely transparent about all of these choices.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk framing of the Piazza paper

**Evaluate the Framing**

1. Research question

2. Key concepts

3. Connections to the literature
:::

::: notes

Let's start by exploring the framing of the article.

- GROUPS, take a few minutes and get ready to share your thoughts about the framing of this research paper

- Think BIG PICTURE, e.g. how the researchers set up their project

<br>

REPORT BACK and DISCUSS

<br>

- Research Q: ???

**SLIDE**: The models

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Evaluate the Models**

1. Polarization and Dehumanization (p482)

2. Moral Polarization (p486)

3. Polarization and Group Mobilization (p489)

::: notes

Our next task is to dig into the models of political violence explored in this paper.

<br>

This paper proposes, and then tests, three conceivable models of political violence in a democracy.

- Assign each GROUP to one MODEL

<br>

GROUPS, I want you to do two things:

1. Explain how the mechanism works

    - e.g. diagram the interests, institutions and interactions in your model ON THE BOARD

2. Evaluate the model

    - How convincing do you find it as a theoretical explanation of violence in a democracy?

- Go!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's step through each

## Polarization and Dehumanization {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/07_2-Brazil_protest.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The article uses Brazil as a case study to illustrate this mechanism in action

:::




## Moral Polarization {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/07_2-Turkey_Secular_Protest.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The article uses Turkey as a case study to illustrate this mechanism in action

- This protest was in favor of protecting Turkey's secular nature of the government

3. Polarization and Group Mobilization (p489)

::: notes

**Ok, where do we end up with these?**

- **Are these distinct and separate models or are they all one model?**

<br>

**Do these models speak to the debate between Weber and Olson about the nature of the state and violence?**

- e.g. the state is violence vs the state uses violence?

<br>

**What do we see from applying these models to the United States today?**

- **Any specific concerns?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's take all this theory material into the empirical world

GROUPS, let's first evaluate the US survey analyses in the paper

- Get ready to report back your analyses

<br>

1. What did Piazza do?

2. Are you convinced by the quality of the survey?

3. Are you persuaded by the findings?

### What does this model tell us about promoting democracy as a strategy for reducing political violence around the world?

<br>

**Do these results conflict with the findings of the article last class by Davenport and Armstrong? Why or why not?**

Canvas Assignment: Case Studies of Groups Reducing Political Violence in Democracies

Submit to Canvas a recent example of an individual, group, country or group of countries taking a specific action to stop a democracy from engaging in political violence.
