Prep for Class

1. Think about timing for each phase of the group work as I'm not sure I want them sharing definitions in class
    - Say, 12 minutes each (time for group to work and collecting answers on boards)

<br>

Tilly, Charles. 2003. “Varieties of Violence.” In The Politics of Collective Violence, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1–25. ONLY p1-20

<br>

Welcome back all

- Today we continue our work gathering and analyzing real world cases in an effort to give us a solid foundation for studying "political violence."

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with a quick refresh from last class.

### [**How do we explore political violence "scientifically"?**]{style="color:red;"}

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

```{r, fig.retina = 3, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 8, fig.height=1, out.width='100%'}
d1a <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 0, 3),
  y = c(1, 1, 1),
  labels = c("Nature", "Measurement", "Data")
)

ggplot(data = d1a, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -2.3, xend = -1.2, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow()) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1.2, xend = 2.5, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

Last class we began to situate ourselves in the processes we need to explore "political violence" in a "scientific" manner.

### Remind me, what are the keys elements of a "scientific method"?

- Goal is inference
- Procedures are public 
- Uncertain conclusions
- Content is method

<br>

### What does this diagram leading from nature to measurement to data help us understand?
1. (Our BIG goal is to develop models of nature / the world)
    - Models, simplifications of reality, allow us to explain causality and make predictions

2. (We use data and reasoning to learn about the world, BUT all data is measured)
    - Measurement requires choices and those choices produce uncertainty
    
3. (The more data we have and the better we understand our measurements the closer we come to being able to create useful models of nature!)

<br>

### Any questions on these big ideas?

**Prepare the Case Studies for Analysis**

1. What is the specific act in your case?

2. Why is this specific act an example of "politics"?

3. Why is this specific act an example of "violence"?

:::

::: notes

On Monday we gathered a number of political violence case studies.

- These cases represent different perspectives on the political violence concept.

- We worked on Monday to prepare these cases for analysis by focusing them on certain aspects I think we'll be most useful to us

<br>

Today we take the next step in this case study analysis.
- We need a definition!

<br>

*Split class into 5 groups (this represents the number of different instruments designed in class Friday so keep it manageable on spreadsheet)*

- PLEASE try to work with people you haven't worked with as much in the past

<br>

Go sit with your group

**Using Case Studies to Define "Political Violence"**

<br>

### 1) Common Characteristics

:::

::: notes

Groups, first job, make a list of the characteristics common to all of the cases presented on Monday.

- Keep this list as objective as possible, e.g. clear characteristics

- Avoid using the words "political" or "violence" because that's what we're trying to define.

<br>

### Any questions? 

Get to it!

<br>

*ON BOARD* (column 1 of 3): "Common Characteristics"

- ADD to list and DISCUSS each

<br>

Notes from Fall 2025

- Murder/Attempted murder
- Direct challenge to security / status quo

Notes from Fall 2019

- Victim: Person or object
- Person(s) impeded physically or harmed

**Using Case Studies to Define "Political Violence"**

<br>

### 1) Common Characteristics

### 2) Types of Cases

:::

::: notes

Let's now look for ways we could group the cases in terms of their shared similarities

- Groups make a list of the different ways we can organize the cases in most-similar groups.

<br>

Think of this like going to the grocery store
- Different items are usually organized by if they need to be refrigerated, frozen or not

- Within those sections they are even more subdivided
    - Refrigerator: Meat vs Seafood vs Dairy 

- Shelf space is typically organized by item cost (highest = most expensive)

- etc

### Make sense?

<br>

*ON BOARD* (column 2 of 3): "Types"

- ADD to list and DISCUSS each

<br>

Notes from FA 23

- Intimidation vs other
- Protecting everyone vs some people
- Success vs failure
- Attempted vs executed
- In the US vs outside the US
- Violence by government vs non-govt
- Targeting groups vs targeting individuals
- Type of weapon

Notes from Spring 2022

- Direct actions vs support
- Coups vs not
- National vs International
- State sponsored vs not
- Individual vs Group
- Politics attempted prior to attack or not
- Religious motive?
- Religious target?
- Territory/Resources
- Physical vs emotional pressure
- action vs potentiality
- Support / Oppose SQ

Notes from Fall 2019

- Revolution vs "other"
- Physical vs non-physical
- Government vs Group vs Indiv
- Beatings vs denying access to needs
- SQ survives vs SQ changes
- Goals met vs not
- Preventing vs escalating
- Developed world vs non-developed

Notes from Fall 2014

- Leaders or opposition
- People vs party
- 1 dead vs more than one?
- Lethal actions vs non-lethal
- Old or new grievances
- Government vs non-government violence
- Targeting people or property
- Terrorism or not
- Individual perpetrator or group

**Using Case Studies to Define "Political Violence"**

<br>

1) Common Characteristics

2) Types of Cases

3) Key Questions
    - Is it "political violence"?
    - How much "political violence"?

:::

::: notes

Ok, now let's work as a class.

### How do we translate the work from these first two exercises into key questions?

### - Think of these as a set of questions that you will use to decide BOTH if something is "political violence" and how much "political violence" it represents.

<br>

*ON BOARD* (column 3 of 3): "Key Questions"

<br>

Notes from FA23

- Who was harmed?
- Who commited the act?
- What motivated the act?
- What did they use?
- What was the goal? Was it met?
- Where did it happen?
- Consequences for the perpetrator?
- Consequences for society?
- Type of harm done?
- What happened?
- # killed / injured
- Scope of attack?
- Economic damage done?

Notes from Spring 2022

- Does it impact the SQ?
- Who did it?
- What was the goal?
- What was the motivation?
- Did it succeed?
- Was harm intended?
- How was it justified?
- Who were the victims?
- How much damage?
- Does it connect to prior actions? (Tilly's episodic nature)
- What was the action?

Fall 2019

- What damage was done?
- What methods of oppression?
- How did levels of violence change?
- What is there to gain for the actor?
- Did the actor meet their goals?
- What motivated the actor?
- Did the SQ change?
- Who acted?
- Who were the victims?
- Who were the aggressors?
- Did the balance of power change?
- Is the act sufficiently clear?

Fall 2014

- Who acted? Leaders or opposition
- What was harmed? People or Property
- How many died? 1 or more
- Did people have to die? Lethal action or non-lethal
- Does it seek to change policy? The status quo?
- Must government be involved as a perpetrator or target?
- Must actual harm to property or life be done?
- How much harm is needed?
- Does motivation matter? Pre-meditated actions?

**Tilly (2003) on Collective Violence**
:::

![](Images/02_2-protestors_fire.jpg)

::: notes

I wanted to expose you to some academic writing on violence and this seemed the best of the lot.

+ The Tilly reading is not meant to replace your good judgement in this exercise.

+ Also, Tilly is defining a slightly different concept than we are.

<br>

### How does our work this week compare to Tilly's definition of "collective violence"?

+ (Tilly's definition of politics is SUPER NARROW, e.g. involving government)

<br>

### What are the key characteristics of Tilly's definition of "collective violence"?

+ (Collective violence as contentious politics)
+ (Episodic)
+ (Social interaction e.g. at least two people)
+ (Immediate physical damage to persons and/or objects)

<br>

Back to your groups!

[**Define "Political Violence"**]{style="color:white;"}
:::

::: notes

Groups take everything we've worked on today and construct a definition of "political violence."

### Questions on what I'm asking you to do?

- Go!

<br>

*You go around and give feedback, help facilitate discussion in the groups*

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

1. Submit your group's working definition of political violence

2. Read "From Abstract to Concrete: Operationalization and Measurement" (Brians, Willnat, Manheim & Rich 2011) (**ONLY p88-110**)

::: notes

Friday we move to instrumentation and measurement so we can quantify the "political violence" in our cases. 

- Take some time to make sure you're happy with your working definition and then email it to me.
