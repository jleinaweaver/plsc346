**Defining our Key Concepts**

- "Political Violence"

- "Strategy"
:::

::: notes

Last week we focused primarily on these two concepts.

- This meant spending time unpacking your prior knowledge about each concept and exploring the roots of them.

- As social scientists, our job is to explain behavior and the argument I am developing for you is that we cannot understand the former without thinking carefully about the latter.

<br>

With that in mind, talk to me about the concept of strategy.

### What were your takeaways from the Freedman book chapters and the simulations we ran in class?

<br>

Freedman's big argument in his book is that strategy is fundamental to the social world

- That we can't understand any social relationship or dynamic (e.g. violence) without politics

<br>

Strategy is hard to define...

- "...attempts to think about actions in advance, in light of our goals and our capacities" (p.x).

- Identifying objectives and the resources and methods available to meet them (p.xi).

- "It's about getting more out of a situation than the starting balance of power would suggest. It's the art of creating power" (p.xii).

<br>

### Any questions on the material from last week?

### [**How do we explore political violence "scientifically"?**]{style="color:red;"}

::: notes

This week I want us to root our exploration of political violence in the empirical world.

- And that means working scientifically with data!

<br>

Time for you to reach way back to your in intro classes and tell me:

### How do we study the social world in a "scientific" manner?

#### - What do we have to do?

**Scientific Method**

- Goal is inference

- Procedures are public 

- Uncertain conclusions

- Content is method

**What does inference mean?**

- ("a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.")
    - Thanks Google!

- (Also refers to our effort to draw conclusions about the wider population based on analyzing a sample of it)

<br>

**Why must your "procedures" be "public"?**

<br>

**Which conclusions are "uncertain"? All of them or just some of them?**

- (ALL OF THEM)

<br>

**What does "content is method" mean?**

- "Science" is not a subject, it is a description for how we study any subject

<br>

**Questions?**

### [**How do we explore political violence "scientifically"?**]{style="color:red;"}

::: notes

So, our aim this semester is to generate "conclusions" about "political violence" using the principles of the scientific method.

<br>

**SLIDE**: That makes our goal inference, and inference means we need data!

  #annotate("segment", x = 1.2, xend = 2.5, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

<br>

The good news is, everybody brought case study evidence to class today.

### Are the cases you brought to class "data"? Why or why not?
- (Sure. Kind of!)

<br>

Empirical data is information acquired through observation.

- Each case you brought represents someone's observations about an event

- Each case likely includes many observations each of which tell us something different about the event you chose.

<br>

### So, what is our next step in converting those observations into data we can analyze?
- (**SLIDE**: Measurement!)

```{r, fig.retina = 3, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 8, fig.height=1, out.width='100%'}
d1a <- tibble(
  x = c(0, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Measurement", "Data")
)

ggplot(data = d1a, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-1, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1, xend = 2.5, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

In this case I am using "measurement" to represent the work we do:

- identifying the variables we are interested in, 

- operationalizing those variables, and then 

- producing values for each variable.

<br>

This is an important idea for us to never lose sight of.

- All "knowledge" depends on "data" and all "data" depends on "measurement"

<br>

THIS is why science requires us to be transparent in our methods

- Without understanding the measurement process the data is almost useless

<br>
    
THIS is why science forces us to acknowledge that all conclusions are uncertain

- Measurement is a human process of converting observations into data
- There is no "perfect" measurement because all measurement requires making choices.

<br>

So, even if your interest is simply in doing descriptive scientific analyses of political violence...

- e.g. How much political violence in State X or State X is much more violent toward its citizens than State Y

You HAVE to think critically about where your data comes from!

<br>

This is the level you will be working on in the first two papers in this class.

- Descriptions analyzed both for what they show and the uncertainty they contain.

```

::: notes

Now, here's the deal.

- Descriptive scientific analyses are important and very useful, HOWEVER...

- Our secod goal is to develop an understanding of WHY these descriptions are happening.

<br>

"Nature" here represents the actual process in the world that creates the outcomes we are interested in.

- Includes all the complexity of the world that combines to result in something.

<br>

The ultimate goal of science is to develop models of these natural processes!

- Models are simplifications of reality designed to allow us to better understand the natural mechanisms that make the outcomes we are interested in.

<br>

### Name me an example of a scientific model you've heard of!
- Natural sciences: Gravity, evolution, ...
- IR: Neorealism: States are first and foremost motivated by a desire to survive.
- Americanists: Ponder on leverage! Presidential "power" is greatest when personal approval is higher than general trust in government

<br>

Oversimplified, our aim is to use data to learn about the world of political violence

- Doing that requires thinking carefully about where our data comes from BOTH in terms of the natural processes that underpin them AND our attempts to measure the world we observe.

<br>

### Does all of that make a vague sort of sense?

- We'll work through this process a bit this week and that should help!

## For Today {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-Assignment.png)

::: notes

This week we are going to explore, define and measure the central concept of our semester "political violence."

- We will do this by exploring both real-world case studies and the academic literature.

<br>

For today everyone should have brought a news article that describes a recent act of political violence.

### Does everyone have their article?

<br>

Based on the Canvas responses I can see that everyone has some grasp of their case.

- To begin converting these cases into data I want each of you to clarify the key observations in your case

<br>

Everybody open the Google Sheet in our Canvas Module for this week: "Wk02 - Case Studies"

- We'll work together to place our cases on the sheet

- To start, copy your APA citation to the sheet next to your name

<br>

Review all the citations.

### Are all of these APA?

- If not, fix 'em!

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

**Prepare the Case Studies for Analysis**

:::

<br>

### 1. What is the specific act in your case?

::: notes

**YOU add next column: What is the specific "act"?**

<br>

Ok, first question: What is the specific act in your case that you have identified as "political violence"?

<br>

By "specific act" I mean that literally.

- The conflict in Sudan or the Cold War are the titles of books.

- Our focus is on a specific actor or group of actors making a specific decision, e.g. attacking a market on a specific date to achieve a specific aim.

- Actor X did action Y to Actor Z on this date... 

<br>

Feel free to discuss with the people around you!

- Bounce ideas off of each other and then fill in the spreadsheet

<br>

### YOU review all the submitted answers, do any need more detail?

:::

<br>

### 2. Why is this specific act an example of "politics"?

::: notes

**YOU add next column: Why "political"?**

<br>

Don't rush this answer, give it some thought.

- Think about all the elements of "politics" we've discussed in this class and others

- What was the actor trying to achieve in a strategic sense? 

- How did the event come out of community dynamics?

- What elements of distribution or rule-making were at stake?

<br>

Feel free to discuss with the people around you!

- Bounce ideas off of each other and then fill in the spreadsheet

<br>

### YOU review all the submitted answers, do any need more detail?

### 3. Why is this specific act an example of "violence"?

::: notes

**YOU add next column: Why "violence"?**

<br>

Don't rush this answer either, give it some thought and discuss it.

- Think about the nature of violence as we've been discussing it and use this to explain why your case is a good example of it.

- Bounce ideas off of each other and then fill in the spreadsheet

<br>

  x = c(0, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Measurement", "Data")
)

  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1, xend = 2.5, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

Ok, let's hear all the cases!

- Remember, these cases represent the sources we will be working with this week in trying to generate useful data about political violence.

<br>

This means it is super IMPORTANT we listen to each other carefully.

- Be an active listener e.g. does anything need clarification?

- Don't change your answers to numbers two and three! We need to hear diverse perspectives.

<br>

Also bear in mind, the goal here is not to define the concept, just to prepare the cases for analysis.

### Everybody ready?

Ok, go!

Excellent work, keep these in mind and will pick up the exercise on Wednesday.

- Read the Tilly chapter on violence and see if that alters your thinking about the concepts we started working on today.
