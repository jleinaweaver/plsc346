Prep for Class

1. Review submissions on Canvas

2. Prep a Google sheet for unpacking cases and publish on Modules
    - [LINK]
    
3. Save notes from today for next class (e.g. end of class operationalization elements need to go into slides for next class)

<br>

Today we kick off the third section of our class.

<br>

What explains the variation in how and why non-state actors use political violence?

- Specifically, we'll focus on terrorism.

For this week we attack "terrorism" using the steps we worked through in Week 2 (and since).

<br>

Our prompt for today focused on the concept of "terrorism"

- Each of you has brought in a case that you argue represents this concept

- Today we review, compare and contrast your cases to unpack our assumptions about the concept AND broaden our familiarity with the real-world debates about it

- Ultimately our goal today is to operationalize the concept

<br>

### Refresh my memory, what does it mean to operationalize a concept and how do I know if my operationalization is useful?

- (Operationalization is "...selecting observable phenomena to represent abstract concepts" (89).)

- ("To be useful...operational definitions must tell us **precisely and explicitly** what to do in order to determine what quantitative value should be associated with a variable in any given case (92).)

<br>

As we did in Week 7 I'd like us to begin by unpacking your cases.

- **SLIDE**: Everybody open up the link to the Google Sheet on Modules: Wk10 - Unpacking the Cases: Terrorism

<br>

**Any questions on these prompts?**

<br>

That last one gives you space for any other important details that explain why you chose this case that isn't captured in these other questions.

<br>

Go!

<br>

Everybody take a few minutes to review the cases

- Try to get a sense of what was submitted and how they might fit together under a single conceptual label.

<br>

**Any questions or need for clarification on the cases?**

*Split class into small groups (4?)*

<br>

GROUPS, compare and contrast all of the cases in order to construct a definition of terrorism

- In a sense, ask yourself what is common or most important to the cases unpacked by our class and use that to build a definition.

- You do not have to include elements from all six questions! 
    - Your group should determine what is important and what isn't in your definition

<br>

### Questions?

- Let's go! Get those definitions up on the board!

<br>

PRESENT and DISCUSS each

### Out of curiosity, as you scrolled through the "data" which variables struck you as most important? Why?

<br>

Class Notes

*2019 class*

Common Chars

- one-sided violence
- Important purpose more important than survival
- Cause fear
- Political
- Non-state actor

Alright, let's combine our efforts.

- Can we operationalize terrorism based on our work today?

- *ON BOARD*

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

Submit reflections on Canvas:

1. Tilly (2004). Terror, Terrorism, Terrorists.

2. Schmid (2023). Defining Terrorism.

::: notes

Next class I've assigned you two academic attempts to define terrorism.

- Let's read those and see how they compare with our work!
