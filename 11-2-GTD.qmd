## Measuring Terrorism: RDWTI {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

<br>

**Research Questions**

1. What are the pros and cons of using this as our primary database of terrorism?

2. Is the damage caused by terrorism getting worse over time?

3. Where are the terrorism hot spots in the world?

4. Are the characteristics of terrorism changing?

::: notes

On Monday we evaluated the RAND Database of Worldwide Terrorism Incidents (RDWTI) and analyzed its data

<br>

### Refresh my memory, what were our answers to these four questions for the RDWTI?

<br>

Today we move to our second big project that aims to measure terrorism events around the world: the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)

<br>

The full GTD database is 100 MB with 135 variables measuring 201k observations.

- That's functionally impossible to manage easily in Excel BUT super easy in R

<br>

The data and codebook to access the GTD are on Canvas

- I gave you a few different ways to explore the dataset

1. Full dataset

2. Full dataset at 5 year intervals, 1970 to 2020

3. The US only across time

<br>

1) What are the pros and cons of using this as our primary database of terrorism?

    - Who is the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism?
    
    - Are the measures valid?
    
    - Are the measures reliable?

::: notes

Groups take 10 minutes to make two lists you can put on the board: Pros vs cons

<br>

Think about the project in broad strokes

- Who is the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism?

- How do they define the key concepts?

- How are they measuring terrorism?

## Global Terrorism Database (GTD) {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

+ Maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland

+ Includes an advisory oversight board with academic experts in the field of terrorism studies

+ Contains information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks

+ Currently the most comprehensive **unclassified** database on terrorist attacks in the world

::: notes

**After reading through the website material do you have any concerns about institutional biases?**

<br>

**Is the "unclassified" note here hinting at something we don't know about that they do know about?**

<br>

**Ok, talk to me about the data collection methodology.**

- **How do they collect their data?**

<br>

(p10)

- combines automated and manual data collection strategies
- over one million media articles on any topic published daily worldwide - Lexis Nexis for English and BBC Monitoring for English-language translations of sources from around 150 countries in over 100 languages
- First pass: customized keyword filters and natural language processing (NLP) to identify terrorism articles
- Second pass: Researchers review subset of articles identified and code them.
- Quality Control: The coding strategy relies on six coding teams that each specialize on a particular domain of the GTD Codebook.

## GTD Defines Terrorism {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center .smaller}

+ The incident must be intentional...
+ The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence...
+ The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors...

Plus, at least two of the following criteria:

1. The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. 
2. There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims.
3. The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities.

::: notes

**How does this compare to the definitions we've considered in class?**

- **The class case study definition?**

- **Tilly's (2004) definition / four steps?**
    - (1. recurrent strategy of intimidation, 2. wide variety of actors use it, 3. related to other forms of political struggle, 4. specialists in coercion incredibly dangerous)

- **Schmid's (2003) academic consensus?**
    - ("Terrorism refers, on the one hand, to a doctrine about the presumed effectiveness of a special form or tactic of fear-generating, coercive political violence and, on the other hand, to a conspiratorial practice of calculated, demonstrative, direct violent action without legal or moral restraints, targeting mainly civilians and non-combatants, performed for its propagandistic and psychological effects on various audiences and conflict parties; Terrorism as a tactic is employed in three main contexts: (i) illegal state repression; (ii) propagandistic agitation by non-state actors in times of peace or outside zones of conflict; and (iii) as an illicit tactic of irregular warfare employed by state- and non-state actors.")

- **Jaggar's (2005) definition?**
    - ("Terrorism is the use of extreme threats or violence designed to intimidate or subjugate governments, groups, or individuals. It is a tactic of coercion intended to promote further ends that in themselves may be good, bad or indifferent. Terrorism may be practiced by governments or international bodies or forces, sub-state groups or even individuals. Its threats or violence are aimed directly or immediately at the bodies or belongings of innocent civilians but these are typically terroristsâ€™ secondary targets; the primary targets of terrorists are the governments, groups or individuals that they wish to intimidate.")

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's compare it to the RAND database from Monday.

:::



## RAND Defines Terrorism {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

Terrorism is defined by the nature of the act, not by the identity of the perpetrators or the nature of the cause; key elements include:

+ Violence or the threat of violence
+ Calculated to create fear and alarm
+ Intended to coerce certain actions
+ Motive must include a political objective
+ Generally directed against civilian targets
+ Can be a group or an individual

::: notes

**Compare and contrast: Has the GTD made any big or particularly useful changes? Or is this basically the same thing?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before we move off the definition, let's talk about this two out of three rule in the extra criteria.

:::



## {background-image="Images/00-Leviathan_Cover_55.png" .center}

```{r}
d |> 
  count(crit1, crit2, crit3) |>
  mutate(
    Proportion = n / sum(n)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    crit1 = if_else(crit1 == 1, "Yes", ""),
    crit2 = if_else(crit2 == 1, "Yes", ""),
    crit3 = if_else(crit3 == 1, "Yes", "")
  ) |>
  rename("Criteria 1" = crit1, "Criteria 2" = crit2, "Criteria 3" = crit3, Count = n) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align = "c")
```

1. The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. 

2. There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims.

3. The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities.

::: notes

Here we see the proportion of cases that meet each of the three additional criteria.

- Each row tells us what proportion of cases qualify as terrorism by including some of the criteria.

- Bottom row shows us 171k cases, or around 85% of the sample, meet all three criteria for inclusion.

- On the other end, approximately 2,300 cases, or around 1% of the sample, qualify by meeting only criteria 2 and 3 but not 1. 

<br>

### Everybody clear on how to read this table?

<br>

### What conclusions can we draw from this? Does this tell us anything important about their views of terrorism?
- (98% of the cases in this dataset include the first two criteria (85+13).)

- So, the researchers are telling us that, essentially, ALL terrorism meets criteria 1 and 2.

<br>

### The question for us is, what does criteria 3 add to our understanding? Why do they need it?

- Since a case must meet 2 out of 3 criteria, I'd like to know if the 2% of cases that qualify by including criteria 3 with only one of the others looks like the rest.

- I'll spare you the insanity but I went down quite the rabbit hole with this and the cases looked fairly similar across the variables in this dataset.
    - Some differences, but nothing crazy.

Ok, let's talk about the differences here.

**Which line is the better estimate of fatalities due to terrorism? Why?**

<br>

**What explains the difference:**

- Sample selection, 

- The definition of terrorism, and/or

- The definition of fatalities?

<br>

**Can we identify what is specific to 2008-2009 that Rand picks up on? Is this violence in Iraq/Afghanistan?**

This version of the plot expands each bar to 100% so we can see the proportion of weapons used in each year.

- It definitely isn't!!

::: notes

Rather than a count of attacks, here we see a sum of the fatalities.

### What conclusions can we draw from this?

<br>

### Are we more confident using the GTD database to count terrorist attacks or fatalities due to attacks? Why?

<br>

Let's end by focusing on the US experience of terrorism over the last ten years.

- Filter the GTD report for the USA and 2010 to 2020.

- Get ready to tell me what the cases look like.

::: notes

Here we see summary statistics for the variables we've been exploring but focused on the US from 2010 to 2020.

### Any questions on the columns in this table?

<br>

### What do we learn from this?

**At this point, would you recommend decision-makers use the RAND database or GTD to better understand terrorism around the world? Why?**
