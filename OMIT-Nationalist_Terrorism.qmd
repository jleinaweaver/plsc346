*Read Question*

Two weeks ago we used case studies to broaden our intuitions of terrorism and to work to operationalize the concept.

Last week we analyzed two (or three?) of the big research projects that focus on measuring terrorism around the world and across time.

<br>

### In thinking about all of this material over the last two weeks, talk to me about what you think terrorism means in broad strokes.

### - In other words, how do we define terrorism?

### - Can it ever be morally permissible?

This week I want us to explore the types of terrorism that are discussed in the world.

- Most people seem to assume that types of terror group matter for understanding the actions of those groups.

I want us to explore some of these "types" while challenging this assumption.

- Specifically we'll ask, **is it really the case that nationalist terrorism is fundamentally different from religious terror?**

- And, if so, **do they require different policy solutions?**

<br>

Today we explore Sanchez-Cuenca's (2007) arguments concerning nationalist terrorism.

Let's talk about the framing of the paper.

### What is the question and how is it worded?
("What makes nationalist terrorism different from revolutionary, fascist, or religious terrorism is the territorial claim.")

<br>

### What literature is the paper connected to?

<br>

### What are the key concepts and how are they defined?

::: notes

This paper is primarily a descriptive analysis of two detailed case studies so we'll follow the paper and blend discussion of the model and the analyses.

<br>

BUT, let's make sure we have the right target in mind.

Turn to the conclusion section on p302:

### After all the theory and data gets analyzed, what is the main conclusion of the paper?

::: notes

*Read conclusion*

<br>

### As a contrast, what does the author argue is the purpose of revolutionary or religious terrorism?
- (Mobilization)
- "Violence is considered a means to induce people to join the revolutionary movement (violence as "propaganda by the deed" or "armed propaganda")" (291).

<br>

Let's keep track of how we evaluate the strength of this conclusion on the board as we work.

*ON BOARD (2 sections): Strengths vs Weaknesses*

- By strength let's say we mean that it adds more signal than noise.

- By weakness let's say adds more noise than signal.

Let's start with the case selection (p290-294).

The paper focuses on ETA in Spain and the IRA in Ireland.

### First, are these comparable cases? Why or why not?

#### - Key similarities?

#### - Possibly problematic differences?

### Bottom line, are these two cases sufficiently comparable?

<br>

### AND, and do these two cases allow us to make generalizations about nationalist terrorism?

### - In other words, do the analyses of these two cases speak to nationalist terrorism found elsewhere in the world? Why or why not?
