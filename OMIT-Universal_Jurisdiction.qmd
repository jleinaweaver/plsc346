.size50[Propose a specific strategy for reducing political violence by state governments. This can be focused at any level of action (e.g. individual, group, states, etc.).]

::: notes

This is an argument paper so every claim must be supported by evidence.

You can start from any of the examples we've discussed in class over the last two weeks or one of the two ideas we'll be studying this week.

### Any questions on the assignment?

::: notes

We need to split the class into two groups to cover the two sides of this argument.

### So, who wants to work on which side of the debate?

*Split class into two groups*

- Even them out if groups very uneven

<br>

Please keep in mind, the goal today is **NOT TO WIN** the argument.

The goal is to make sure we fully understand the trade-offs in embracing or rejecting this policy option.

In 15 minutes I want each group to put their strongest case leading to this conclusion on the board.

### Questions?

Get to work!

In a moment I'll ask each group to present their argument diagram.

Listening group, your job is to listen and the give them feedback.

Help them identify the strongest and weakest parts of the diagram.
- Which premises need to be clarified? 
- Any holes in the logical flow?

<br>

*Present Argument 1*

*Group 2, give them feedback*

*Present Argument 2*

*Group 1, give them feedback*

<br>

Groups, 10 minutes, take the feedback on board and now revise your argument on the board.

*Present Each*

Ok, bottom line, where do we end up?

### Under what specific conditions, do the trade-offs tip towards supporting the norm?

### Under what specific conditions, do the trade-offs tip away from  supporting the norm?

Hopefully our work today has helped you take a practice run at answering the question in paper 2.

On Wednesday we'll repeat this exercise focused on R2P.
