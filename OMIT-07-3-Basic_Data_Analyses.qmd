]

::: notes

Let's talk general rules of thumb when producing visualizations for a professional audience.

- This means producing high quality visualizations that would look good in any presentation, report, book, web post, poster, etc.

<br>

1. Include an informative title
    - EVERY visualization should have a title that tells the viewer the main point of the analysis
    - Don't force them to guess or to struggle to decipher the point, just tell them.

2. Add a label to the figure (with a figure number)
    - e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3
    - Otherwise it's impossible to refer to it in the text
    - Plus a caption to explain what is being shown in the visualization

3. Identify the source(s)
    - Somewhere on the Figure or in the label you MUST make clear where the data came from

4. Ensure the axis labels are clear and readable

5. Maximize the data-to-ink ratio
    - As much as possible, the "ink" should be tied directly to data
    - e.g. No extra 3-d nonsense!
    - e.g. No big empty spaces

6. No chart junk!
    - It's super easy to add nonsense to your plot and much of it simply distracts from the central point of the visualization.
    - Focus on the central argument of the viz!

<br>

::: notes

A polished but simple visualization

- Includes an informative title,

- Figure is labeled in the text so I can refer to it and the figure caption explains what is being shown,

- Sources are identified

- Axis labels are clear

- Empty space here is to show the full scale of the variable

- No chart junk

Everybody make a line plot of physint_sum across time for one of your countries

- Polish the figure and get ready to share what you've made!

- Including a short figure caption!

<br>

Everybody walk around the class and check out what everyone else has done!

- Give feedback and steal best ideas

#### EXCEL NOTES
- Make sure to remove NAs (need empty cells)
- Select the Year column and the physint_sum, insert scatter plot with connected points

::: notes

Let's now work with using descriptive statistics to make a comparison and then to present those results as a table.

- Same variable for one country calculate: minimum, median, maximum, mean, sd

- Repeat calculations for rest of countries in dataset

- Make a table
