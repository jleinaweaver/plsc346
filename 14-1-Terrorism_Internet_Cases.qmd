Prep for Class

1. Review submissions on Canvas

<br>

In this final section of our work on terrorism we have been exploring the cutting-edge of terrorism research

- Last week we examined the literature on the rise of far-right terrorism (FRT), radicalization in the United States and whether or not there are significant differences in the kinds of terror used by different ideological groups.

<br>

This week we shift to examining the interaction between terrorism and the internet

1. How is the terror strategy adapting to a digital world?

2. Does the literature find evidence of these mechanisms in action?

3. How could we contribute to this new area of research?

### Has the internet transformed terrorism as a strategy of political violence?

1. Describe the case (Actor? Action? Target?)

2. How does this show us the internet has changed terrorism?

::: notes

For today I asked everybody to submit a case we could use to develop our intuitions about this complicated interaction.

<br>

**Everybody ready to go with this?**

<br>

*Go around the room and hear what everyone brought and why they selected it*

- Let's review the submitted cases and get any clarifications we may need

<br>

*Split class into small groups (4-ish)*

- Go sit with your group and claim space on the board

### Therefore, cyber terrorism (the intersection between terrorism and the internet) requires us to alter our definitions of terrorism


::: notes

GROUPS I want you to build this argument on the board

- What are the strongest reasons we can come up with to make the case that terrorism has been fundamentally changed by the internet

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*
